It is situated in the town centre on Watford High Street, approximately outside London. St Mary's is the parish church of Watford and is part of the Anglican Diocese of St Albans. Thought to be at least 800 years old, the church contains burials of a number of local nobility and some noteworthy monumental sculpture of the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras. History No documentary records exist of the origins of Watford Parish Church; the earliest parish records do not begin until 1539, but the church is understood to be considerably older. The building seen today is mainly 15th century in origin, although the oldest parts of the fabric are estimated to date from around 1230. During renovations in 1871, church restorers discovered that 12th-century stonework had been incorporated into the later medieval building, and in the hardcore of the tower walls, the basin of a 12th-century baptismal font had been discarded. The presence of masonry from this era suggests that St Mary's Church was probably established at around the same time that the charter was granted for Watford Market to the Lord of the Manor at Cashio, an Abbott of St Albans Abbey. The precise date that this licence was awarded is not known; historians estimate that it was during the reign of either King Henry I (1100-1135) or King Henry II (1154‚Äì1189).Slater & Goose, p.281Slater & Goose, p.278 Among the past vicars of St Mary's was William Capel, son of William Capell, 3rd Earl of Essex and noted amateur cricketer. On 18 July 1909, King Edward VII attended a service of worship during a visit to the Earl of Clarendon at the Grove. He entered the church through the door to the Essex Chapel, which is now known as the Edward VII door.Cooper - \\"The King Enters St Mary's Church\\" The patron of the church was the Earl of Essex. Architecture & Memorials The Nave of Saint Mary's Constructed in stone and faced in flint, the church has a broad clock tower at the west end typical for Hertfordshire, topped with crenelations. The six-bay nave is flanked by north and south aisles lined with octagonal piers, above which runs a clerestory. The nave is topped by a timber roof with the beams resting on carved angels. Seen from the outside, St Mary's is for the most part a 15th-century building; the tower, outer walls of the aisles, clerstory, nave roof and south chancel chapel all date from this period. The chancel forms the older part of the church, the chancel arch and double piscina having been dated as 13th century.Pevesner, p.385 Sometime in the late 13th century, a chapel was added to the south aisle. Dedicated to St Katherine, this chapel was built by John Heydon (d.1400) of The Grove Estate in Watford, and was hence known as the Heydon Chapel. By the time the church was being recorded by the historian John Edwin Cussans in his History of Hertfordshire (1880), the Heydon Chapel was in use as an organ chamber. Carved into one of the pillars which separate the chapel from the chancel was a coat of arms which Robert Clutterbuck identified as the family arms of the Heydons. Detail of George Gilbert Scott's box pews The pulpit dates from 1714, the work of by Richard Bull. The church contains a number of marble monuments to local townspeople, dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. Of particular note is a white marble tablet in the Choristers' Vestry to the memory of Robert Clutterbuck, the author of a History of Hertfordshire. In a vault beneath are also interred many of the Clutterbuck family. Restoration works The church interior was restored in 1848, and the church underwent a major restoration in 1871, led by the architect John Thomas Christopher; plans were also considered at this time for alterations to the church by the architect Sir George Gilbert Scott. During Christopher's refurbishment works the exterior plaster was removed and refaced with knapped flint, battlements were added to the tower, the south aisle walls were rebuilt, new roofs were built, and alterations were made to the 15th-century south chapel. Interior fittings introduced at this time included an ornate stone font carved by James Forsyth and a stone reredos carved by E Renversey. Stained glass by the glassmakers firm Heaton, Butler and Bayne was installed. The oak box pews installed at this time were especially noted as a fine example of carved ornamentation in the Decorated Gothic style with tracery heads and foliate spandrels. A further restoration project was undertaken in 1987, including repairs to the roof and organ. In 1979 a new octagonal church hall was constructed on the south side of the church. 21st-century refurbishment A refurbishment scheme for the church interior was announced in 2014, which involved laying new flooring, installing internal plate glass screens, and the removal of George Gilbert Scott's oak pews to replace them with modern upholstered chairs. The controversial scheme was approved by the Church of England consistory court but was opposed by conservationists; heritage bodies such as the Victorian Society and Historic England, along with Watford Borough Council, objected to the plans. The refurbishment work was carried out from late 2017 to March 2019. The box pews were taken out and the decorated end panels were reused for interior panelling. During removal of the old floor, 13 hidden burial vaults were uncovered which had to be documented and conserved prior to installation of the underfloor heating and new stone floor. Nave Among the memorials which survived the Victorian restoration is a large monumental brass to Hugh de Holes (d.1415) and his wife; de Holes is depicted wearing the judicial robes of a judge. A white marble tablet, on the south wall of the nave, is dedicated to the memory of Jane Bell, wife of John Bell, Esq. Its unusually long epitaph was written by Dr. Samuel Johnson. There are many other minor monuments, including a marble memorial to Anne Derne (d.1790), daughter of John Carpender, by J. Golde of High Holborn. The organ was installed in 1935 and is the work of organ builders J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd. St Mary's is now a Grade I listed building. The Essex Chapel The Essex Chapel in Saint Mary's Sir Charles Morison the elder (1549-1599) by Nicholas Stone St Mary's Watford was the parish church to the nearby Cassiobury Estate and served as a burial place for the nobility of Watford. The north chancel chapel is known as the Essex Chapel, or the Morison Chapel, containing the burials of the Earls of Essex, along with the tombs of Morison and Capel families. This chapel was founded in 1595 by Bridget, Dowager Countess of Bedford and widow of Sir Richard Morison, and Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford and is noted for its outstanding monuments. Two table tombs originally stood in the middle of the chapel, one for Countess Bridget (who died in 1600) and one for Lady Dame Elizabeth Russell (died 1611), the wife of William Lord Russell; these tombs were removed in 1907 to the Bedford family chapel in the Church of St Michael, Chenies, Buckinghamshire. In 1916 the chapel was restored by Adele, Dowager Countess of Essex, in memory of her husband, George Capell, 7th Earl of Essex.Slater & Goose, p.284 The most striking memorials in the chapel are two large wall monuments executed by the sculptor Nicholas Stone, described by Pevsner as \\"the chief glory of Watford Church\\". On one side is the tomb of the politician Sir Charles Morison (1549-1599), son of Dowager Countess Bridget, which features a reclining effigy of Sir Charles in white marble, depicted with a Van Dyke beard and wearing armour and a large Elizabethan ruff round his neck. Morrison is surrounded by an ornate canopy of twin segmental arches supported by two pillars of coloured marble, the family coat of arms, and at either end figures of his son and daughter kneel under sculpted fabric baldacchinos. A long Latin inscription describes his numerous virtues and states that he was the founder of the chapel. Opposite this is the tomb of his son, Sir Charles Morrison, 1st Baronet, who died in 1628, designed in a similar style with semi-reclining figures of Sir Charles and his wife Mary sculpted in marble. Sir Charles is depicted wearing armour, resting on his elbow, with a skull under his hand, raised above the recumbent figure of his wife; she represented reclining on a cushion, wearing a richly embroidered dress of the period and ruff. The figures are enclosed in a four-poster canopy and below them at either end are the kneeling figures of a youth, a boy and a young lady kneeling. The Latin inscription at the bottom describe how their daughter, Elizabeth, married Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham (in 1627). Among the other memorials in the chapel is a mural monument to George Capell-Coningsby, 5th Earl of Essex (1757‚Äì1839), which bears a finely sculpted coat of arms; a memorial to Harriet, daughter of the 5th Earl, who died in 1837, aged 29; a simple marble memorial to Arthur Algernon Capell, 6th Earl of Essex (1803-1892); a memorial to his son, Arthur de Vere Capell, Viscount Malden (1826‚Äì1879); a memorial to Caroline Janetta, wife of the 6th Earl and daughter of the Duke of St. Albans (died 1862); and a brass tablet to Randolph, second son of Janetta and the 6th Earl of Essex, who served in the naval brigade in the Crimean War at the Battle of Inkerman and the Siege of Sebastopol, and died at Rio de Janeiro, in 1857, aged 25, \\"much lamented, soon after he had reached that place.\\" Also buried here is Lady Mary Capell (1722‚Äì1782), the daughter of William Capell, 3rd Earl of Essex and wife of the Royal Navy officer John Forbes. A smaller wall monument depicting a female figure kneeling between two marble pillars has been identified as that of Lady Dorothy Morrison (d.1618), wife of Sir Charles Morrison the elder. The Churchyard Clutterbuck tomb in St Mary's churchyard A number of heritage-listed 18th and 19th-century neoclassical chest tombs can be found in St Mary's churchyard. They contain the burials of several notable Watford townsfolk who were influential in the development of the town as an industrial centre. Among these tombs is that of a ship's captain of the East India Company, James Dundas; the tomb of John Dyson, who founded the Watford brewery which was later to become Benskins Brewery; the tomb of Elizabeth and Ralph Morrison, who died in 1772 and 1780 respectively (no known relation to the Morrisons of Cassiobury House); the Clutterbuck Tomb, marking the burials of the Clutterbuck family, a large Hertfordshire family whose descendants included Robert Clutterbuck, the noted historian who wrote the 1815 county history The History and Antiquities of the County of Hertford; and the grave of George Edward Doney (d. 1809), a freed slave from Virginia who had originally been taken from the Gambia as an infant and who, after emancipation, had been employed as a domestic servant at Cassiobury House by the 5th Earl of Essex. An unusual legend surrounds a grave known as the Fig Tree Tomb; the unknown person buried here was said to have been a convinced atheist who, according to the story, had stated on their deathbed that if there is a God, a fig tree should grow out of their heart. After their death in the early 1800s, a fig tree did indeed grow out of this tomb for many years, breaking through the stone until it was killed by the severe winter of 1962/63.Cooper - \\"The Fig Tree Tomb\\" Location St Mary's lies on Watford High Street, opposite the Watford Intu shopping Centre and approximately from Watford High Street railway station.

TKM worked within the style termed \\"African popular art\\" or \\"genre painting\\" and is known for his prolific paintings depicting key moments of Congolese history as they appeared in folk memory. TKM disappeared in 1981 and is believed to have been killed in rioting. Life and work TKM was born in √âlisabethville (modern-day Lubumbashi), in the south of the Belgian Congo, in 1947. TKM worked within the period of cultural authenticit√© in the 1970s. TKM was one of the leading figures of \\"African genre painting\\" which had emerged in the Belgian Congo in the late 1950s and which integrated both European and Congolese styles and techniques. TKM's best-known paintings form part of a series of 101 works commissioned by the German anthropologist Johannes Fabian to illustrate Congolese history as it appeared in national collective memory. The series was produced between 1974 and 1976 and forms the body of TKM's work and was used as the basis for an academic collaboration between the two. The result, Remembering the Present: Paintings and popular history in Zaire, was published in 1996. TKM viewed the purpose of the book as presenting the history of his country to a child born in the country. by contrast, Fabian presents it as an anthropological work for Western study. Among the scenes depicted by TKM was the Elisabethville Massacre of 1941, Patrice Lumumba's independence speech of 30 June 1960, the introduction of culture obligatoire farming, and the trial of the religious leader Simon Kimbangu by the Belgian colonial authorities in 1921. All the paintings were made at the time of the Shaba Invasions during which TKM's native province of Shaba witnessed widespread political instability. The work is historically significant because of the interviews between Fabian and TKM included in the work. In those interviews, TKM subtly critiques the government of Mobutu Sese Seko, making statements such as \\"What Mobutu has in mind is true - or else it is a lie. But that's something I keep to myself. What is true is that he started out with ideas that were correct. So he spoke and we all agreed; not a single thing was disputed.\\" The work also emphasizes TKM's admiration of Patrice Lumumba, particularly in the use of deliberate Christ imagery in the paintings of Lumumba, specifically mirroring Jesus' wounds after the crucifixion. The parallel is so clear that Fabian names the section \\"The Passion of Patrice Lumumba,\\" a reference to \\"The Passion of the Christ.\\" 102 of TKM's paintings were purchased by the Tropenmuseum, an ethnographic museum in Amsterdam, in 2000.

He grew up in a middle-class working family, he attended the Agricultural Institute and later he graduated in political science at the University of Macerata. In 1994 he joined the Students' Movement, a left-wing organization, and in 1999 he was elected to the city council of Mornico al Serio for the Democrats of the Left (DS). In the early 2000s he became a leading member of the Youth Left, the youth wing of the DS. In 2007 he joined the new-founded Democratic Party and in 2009 he was appointed Responsible for Agriculture in the new secretariat led by Pier Luigi Bersani. In 2013 he was appointed undersecretary to the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies, in the government of Enrico Letta.  Minister of Agriculture  On 22 February 2014, when the new secretary of the PD, Matteo Renzi, forced Letta to resign, becoming the new Prime Minister, he appointed Martina Minister of Agriculture. In 2015 Martina founded Left is Change, a left-wing social-democratic faction within the PD, allied with the centrist ones led by Matteo Renzi and Dario Franceschini. During his tenure as Minister of Agriculture, various measures have been developed and approved in favor of youth employment in agriculture, bureaucratic simplification for businesses, generational turnover and internationalization of enterprises. Furthermore, during his mandate, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which has been in force since 1 January 2015, has been definitively approved. During his ministry, Milan hosted the Universal Exposition; the themes were technology, innovation, culture and traditions concerning food. Participants to the Expo include 145 countries, three international organisations, several civil society organisations, several corporations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The participants are hosted inside individual or grouped pavilions. Martina proposed a law against the so-called caporalato, that is the exploitation of unreported employment in agriculture, which had been a serious and widespread problem especially in Southern Italy.Cosa dice la nuova legge contro il caporalato On 12 December 2016, when Renzi resigned as Prime Minister after the constitutional referendum, Martina was confirmed as Agriculture Minister by the new Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni.Gentiloni presenta governo, Padoan confermato all'Economia In February 2017 the incumbent secretary Matteo Renzi announced an electoral ticket with Martina for the Democratic leadership election in April; Martina would become Deputy Secretary and would probably lead the party if Renzi becomes Prime Minister again.Ecco la sintesi della mozione congressuale di Matteo RenziMaurizio Martina: chi √® il vice (di sinistra) scelto da Matteo Renzi Renzi won by a landslide and Martina was appointed new Deputy Secretary on 7 May.Pd, Matteo Renzi eletto segretario.

Biography Her paternal grandfather was Uwais Khan, the Moghul Khan of Mughalistan and her father's predecessor. Daulat Sultan was a direct descendant of Genghis Khan, the founder and Great Khan (Emperor) of the Mongol Empire through her father's side.

Another nephew, Sa'id, her own brother Ahmad's son, then invited her, with costly gifts, to visit him in Kashghar.

She was born a princess of the Chagatai Khanate as a daughter of Yunus Khan, the Great Khan of Moghulistan and his second wife Shah Begum. Family Sultan Nigar Khanum was born a princess of the Chagatai Khanate as the second daughter of Yunus Khan, the Great Khan of Moghulistan and his second wife Shah Begum. Her paternal grandfather was Uwais Khan, the Moghul Khan of Mughalistan and her father's predecessor. Sultan Nigar was a direct descendant of Genghis Khan, the founder and Great Khan (Emperor) of the Mongol Empire through her father's side. Being the daughter of a Khan, she held the title of \\"Khanum\\" (\\"daughter of a Khan or princess\\") by birth. She was also the step aunt of Emperor Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire of India as well as its first Emperor. Marriages Mahmud Mirza She married firstly to Sultan Mahmud Mirza. With him she had a son, Sultan Wais also known as Khan Mirza. She was widowed in January, 1495. On Mahmud's death in Samarkand she joined her brothers in Tashkent, going off \\"without giving any notice of her intentions,\\" says Babar. Awiq Sultan Later on she, married Awiq Sultan Juji, the chief of the Uzbek Qazaqs. Haidar Mirza throws some light, and it seems that when Shaybani had murdered her brother, Mahmud Khan, Awiq left him and joined the Uzbek Qazaqs, his own people, and Sultan Nigar followed him into Moghalistan. She had two daughters by Awiq, one of whom married Abdullah Quchin and died a young wife, and the other married Rashid Sultan Chaghatai. Qasim Khan On Awiq's death, Sultan Nigar was married to his brother Qasim, presumably in consonance with the Turkish custom of yanglik. With Qasim's death, the khanship of the Qazaqs devolved on Sultan Nigar's stepson named Tahir. He was, says Haidar, \\"very much attached to her, and even preferred her to the mother who had given him birth.\\" Sultan Nigar showed her appreciation of Tahir's affection, but petitioned him, saying: \\"Although you are (as) my child, and I neither think of nor desire any son but you, yet I wish you to take me to my nephew, Sultan Sa'id Khan. For I am grown old, and I have no longer the strength to bear this wandering life in the deserts of Uzbekistan. Take me where I may enjoy some quiet and repose.\\" She then offered to mediate for him and to obtain the support for him of the Mughal Khagans against his foes. Tahir accordingly escorted her to the Moghulistan borders, and with her waited upon Sa'id. \\"The latter, from love of his aunt, rose, saying that although his rising to receive Tahir was contrary to the rules of Genghis (their common ancestor), yet that he did it out of gratitude because Tahir had brought his aunt.\\" Death Sultan Nigar Khanum died of a hemorrhage in the summer of 1528.

Brown (Born April 21, 1932) is an American Democratic Party politician who became the first African American elected to represent Bergen County, New Jersey in the New Jersey Legislature. He was elected in 1965 to serve in the New Jersey General Assembly. Early life and career Brown was born in Englewood, New Jersey on April 21, 1932, the son of John Scott Brown Jr. and Hortense Melle Stubbs. He graduated from Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood in 1949, and from Bowling Green University in 1954. He received a law degree from Rutgers University Law School in 1957. He practiced law in Englewood from 1957 to 1986. In 1985, Brown founded the Du Bois Book Center in Englewood, which specializes in African American Studies and Black Studies. He is the author of Black Loyalists in Bergen County and the Book of Negroes in the Revolutionary War in Bergen County, and the Co-Author of Images of America: Englewood and Englewood Cliffs. He married Lydia Barbara White in 1955; following her death, he married Gwendolyn Wertby. He has four children: Crystal L. Brown, Beverly M. Brown-Fitzhugh, Dale E. Brown-Davis and Arnold E. Brown II. New Jersey State Assemblyman In 1961, at age 29, Brown made his first bid for public office as a candidate for the New Jersey General Assembly. He sought one of seven Bergen County seats, all elected countywide at-large. He faced Republicans Harry Randall Jr., Marion West Higgins, Carmine Savino, Jr., Nelson G. Gross, Joseph C. Woodcock Jr., F. Walton Wanner, and Peter Moraites. Brown ran with Democrats Richard A. Kohler, Emil Starr, M. J. DiMaria, Marc Joseph, Arthur L. McHale, and Carmen Rusignola. Republicans swept all seven seats. Although he lost by more than 41,0000 votes, Brown was the top vote getter among the Democratic candidates. Brown made a second bid for the Legislature in 1965, a more favorable year for Democrats with popular Governor Richard J. Hughes heading the ticket. He ran with six other Democrats: Vito Albanese, Lee M. Carlton, Robert E. Hamer, Jerome L. Yesko, John Skevin, and Stephen J. Moses. Brown was elected, running more than 19,000 votes ahead of Republican R. Parker Birkins. Democrats won six of seven seats, with only Woodcock winning. During his two years as an Assemblyman, Brown's legislative aide was Byron Baer, who later served more than 30 years in the legislature. Brown sought re-election to a second term in 1967, which turned out to be a heavily Republican year statewide. Running in a newly created legislative district, 13B, Brown and his running mate, Assemblyman Vito Albanese, were defeated by Teaneck Mayor Thomas Costa and Englewood Mayor Austin Volk. Costa received 35,439 votes, followed by Volk (35,038], Brown (25,295) and Albanese (24,221).

In addition Dumbarton played in the Dumbartonshire Cup and the Glasgow Charity Cup. Story of the Season June‚ÄìJuly A close season tournament was played for the benefit of Port Glasgow AFC and on 27 June Dumbarton defeated the hosts 7-2, whilst in the other tie, Rangers got the better of Clyde by 4-0. On 9 July the final of the Port Glasgow benefit tournament was played at Ibrox, but with the loss of Taylor early in the game who was ordered off for kicking the Rangers goalkeeper, Rangers were rarely troubled and ran out winners by 4-1. August The 1892-93 season opened on 13 August with a friendly fixture in Dumfries against 5th KRV, and whilst the team was composed mostly of 2nd XI players, Dumbarton still managed a win by 3-2. The league season opened a week later with a home tie against St Mirren. The loss of the backbone of the team ‚Äì added to the three who had travelled south were Taylor who was suspended and McMillan who had yet to decide on his future, meant that the unbeaten league record at ‚Äòfatal‚Äô Boghead would be sorely tested and so it proved with the visitors leaving as the winners by 2-1. On the 27th, Dumbarton travelled to Ayr to play a friendly, and in a foul strewn game came away with a 1-1 draw. September On 3 September Dumbarton had the unenviable task of a visit on league business to Ibrox, and while most pundits expected an easy Rangers win, with the return of McMillan to the fold, Dumbarton put up a strong performance, and although leading twice eventually succumbed by 3-2. The following week saw the visit of Leith Athletic to Boghead, and whilst the game was not great, a 2-1 win ensured that Dumbarton gained their first league points of the season. It was meant to be a league visit to neighbours Renton on 20 September, but as the referee failed to appear, a friendly was played, which Dumbarton won 2-0. A week later, despite having most of the play, Dumbarton allowed Third Lanark to leave Boghead with both points in the league encounter, the latter winning 2-1. So at the end of the month, Hearts topped the league table with 11 points from 6 games, 2 ahead of Rangers who had a game in hand. Dumbarton trailed in 8th with 2 points from 4 games played. October On 1 October, Dumbarton played their return league fixture at Paisley against St Mirren. The match was an even one, and Dumbarton went in at half time 2-1 ahead. However Smith was lost to injury early in the second half and despite scoring a third goal which was disallowed, it was St Mirren that made their 1-man advantagetell by winning 3-2. The following week Dumbarton travelled to play Hearts at Tynecastle. Hearts had been going well in the league, but the introduction of David Thomson and Lawrence Bell to the team, and the return from suspension of Taylor, made a huge difference to the Dumbarton performance, who were well worthy of their 3-1 win. Following on from the previous week's success, Dumbarton looked forward to a home tie against Celtic with an unchanged team. However the Celts completely dominated the game and left Boghead with a 3-0 win. On 24 October, Abercorn were the visitors to Boghead and were soundly thrashed 5-1 ‚Äì Dumbarton's biggest win of the season so far. Interestingly, McLeod left his usual position of goalkeeper to play centre forward in the first half of the game, with Hartley taking his place between the sticks. A week later brought a visit to Boghead by neighbours Renton for a friendly fixture and ended in a 2-1 win for Dumbarton. So at the end of the month Rangers still led the league with 14 points from 8 games, ahead of Hearts a point behind with a game more played. Dumbarton remained in 8th place with 6 points from 8 games. November The return fixture against Third Lanark was played at Cathkin Park on 5 November. Dumbarton were missing Keir and J. Bell due to injury and this showed as a 3-0 defeat was suffered. The following week there was a rest for the club, but not for all the players. John McLeod, Tom McMillan, William Thomson, John Taylor, Abe Hartley and James McNaught were all selected to play in the Dumbartonshire representative team against a Renfrewshire XI at Abercorn's ground. The match was drawn 2-2 with Taylor scoring one of the goals. A return to a full strength squad did not have the desired effect on 19 November as Dumbarton lost away to Leith Athletic by 3-0. Notwithstanding the score, Dumbarton had most of the play but were met by a ‚Äòsuperlative‚Äô display by the Leith goalkeeper. The 26 November saw Dumbarton visit Clyde for their first game in the Scottish Cup. Unfortunately the weather had turned Barrowfield Park into a ‚Äòseries of small lakes‚Äô, nevertheless a friendly was played which Clyde won 4-1. So at the end of November the league was still led by Rangers with 15 points from 9 games, with Celtic and Hearts 2 points behind. Dumbarton still held on to 8th place with 6 points from 10 games. December The first two Saturdays in December were written off due to wintry weather, but at the fourth time of asking the outstanding Scottish Cup tie against Clyde was eventually played off on 17 December. However, with Dumbarton leading 6-1 twenty minutes into the second half, the home crowd invaded the pitch assaulting the referee and some of the Dumbarton players. The referee was unable to continue and the game suspended. However at a subsequent SFA meeting the tie was awarded to Dumbarton. It was supposed to be a return to league duty a week later with Rangers visiting Boghead, but again the weather intervened. And so the final game of 1892 would be the first of Dumbarton's holiday matches with a fine 5-1 away win against Kirkcaldy. January The holiday success at Kirkcaldy was followed by friendly wins over Dunfermline (5-0) and Hearts (2-0) on 2 and 3 January respectively. The following Saturday was supposed to see Rangers visit Dumbarton for a Scottish Cup tie but once again a postponement was necessary due to an unplayable pitch. The same was the case a week later. The long- awaited match took place on 21 January and not for the first time this season it was a case of an inspired goalkeeper who kept the Dumbarton forwards at bay and Rangers left with a 1-0 win. A protest from Dumbarton that the referee ended the match 3 minutes early was subsequently withdrawn. On the same day however it was better news for the second XI as the Dumbarton Rangers defeated the Union reserves to secure the county cup. On 28 January, neighbours Vale of Leven came to Boghead on county cup business, and despite having most of the play Dumbarton had to settle for a 1-1 draw. February Dumbarton answered the doubters in the replay of the semi final of the Dumbartonshire Cup on 4 February at Alexandria by recording a fine 6-2 win. A week later, and being free of league and cup duties, Dumbarton travelled over the Irish Channel to play Linfield Athletic. The 4-2 defeat suffered may have had something to do with the rough journey over to Ireland as most of the Dumbarton team were seasick and had barely recovered when play commenced. It was back to league business on 18 February where Dumbarton travelled to Barrowfield and came away with a 2-1 victory. The chance to bring silverware back to Boghead was not missed as on 25 February Dumbarton easily defeated Levendale 7-1 to lift the county cup for the fifth year in succession. March International trial matches were held on 4 March to consider selection of teams to represent Scotland in the upcoming Home International Championship - John McLeod and John Taylor took part. Despite this, the league match against Renton went ahead on the same day. The result of a 1-1 draw was a fair one ‚Äì bearing in mind that Renton were also short of men for the international trials. Although the absence of McNaught who had travelled south, in addition to the ‚Äòtrialists‚Äô and the sending off of Lawrence Bell in the second half did not help Dumbarton's cause. With the final of the Scottish Cup being played at Hampden, Dumbarton journeyed to London on 11 March to play the Royal Arsenal. Unfortunately while a 3-1 defeat was suffered, the game had other consequences in that the club's president Denny resigned due to his pro-amateurism stance. On 18 March, McLeod, Thomson and John Bell played for Scotland against Wales in an 8-0 victory for the Scots. It was unsurprising then that these men were sorely missed in the league match played against Celtic at Parkhead on the same day ‚Äì a heavy 5-1 beating being handed out. The following week Dumbarton made the trip to Edinburgh to play Hibs in a friendly and in an evenly contested match it was the home team who took the spoils 3-2. So the league at the end of March looked like this; Rangers played 13 with 22 points; St Mirren played 16 with 20 points; Celtic played 12 with 19 points. Dumbarton were stuck in 8th with 9 points from 13 games. April On the first day of April Dumbarton welcomed Hearts to Boghead and achieved a convincing 5-1 win. This would mark John Bell's last game for Dumbarton and his goal scoring skills would be sadly missed. So a week later, while the club had a rest weekend, John Bell and John Taylor earned their second 'League' caps in the Scottish League XI vs. the English League match at Parkhead - the game finishing in a 4-3 win for the English, with Taylor scoring one of the goals. On 15 April, Clyde visited Boghead in the league and left having been defeated 3-1 ‚Äì the first time Dumbarton had strung two successive victories together all season. A week later it was Rangers turn to come to Dumbarton ‚Äì league leaders with an unbeaten record to date but never having won at Boghead ‚Äì and it was Dumbarton who would triumph in a stunning 3-0 victory. However the successful run came to an abrupt end on 29 April, when a visit to Abercorn in the penultimate league game ended in a dismal 4-0 defeat. So at the end of the month Rangers still topped the league with 26 points, with one game left to play, but Celtic were only 3 points behind with 3 games in hand. Dumbarton maintained 8th place with 15 points. May Tuesday 2 May was an important date for Scottish football as it was on this date that the SFA officially accepted professionalism within the sport - Dumbarton was one of the few dissenting voices. Following a free week, Dumbarton travelled to Cathkin Park to meet Celtic in the semi final of the Glasgow Charity Cup, and a close encounter finished in a 0-0 draw. Four days later at the same venue however it was Celtic that prevailed by 3-1. And so on 20 May, the last league game of the season took place at Tontine Park, where Dumbarton defeated Renton handsomely by 4-0. The result meant that Dumbarton leap-frogged Renton into 7th place in the league, and thereby avoided the dreaded reselection process ‚Äì and it was Celtic who claimed their first ever championship, pipping Rangers by a single point. June At the club's AGM a motion to adopt professionalism for the following season was passed. Match results Scottish League Scottish Cup Dumbartonshire Cup Glasgow Charity Cup Port Glasgow Athletic Benefit Tournament Friendlies Player statistics As Dumbarton entered season 1892-93, the defending league champions for the second year running, while professionalism in England was widespread, clubs in Scotland could do little to detract their players from the offers being made by English agents. Dumbarton were no exception and by the start of the season had already lost the services of John Miller to Liverpool, Dickie Boyle to Everton and James Galbraith to Middlesbrough. However, during the season Dumbarton were further weakened by the loss of Abe Harley to Everton (January), James McNaught to Newton Heath (March), John Bell to Everton (April) and William Thomson to Aston Villa (April), not forgetting John Gillan, who had become a first team regular in November, also to Aston Villa (April). Nevertheless, the second XI continued to provide new local talent, and among those stepping up to the senior team were Lawrence Bell, Daniel Thomson, William Nash and Albert Saunderson. |} Source: Reserve Team Dumbarton lost out to Clyde in the third round of the Scottish Second XI Cup but made it five wins on the trot by beating Dumbarton Union in the final of the Dumbartonshire Second XI Cup.

Announced as an upcoming project in 2005 for the Xbox 360, the game's cancellation was later announced in 2008. In late 2014, Sakaguchi released a concept trailer of work done on the game. Synopsis Setting and themes The game's setting was to take place in the Middle Ages, centering on the relationship between humans and small creatures called \\"Bogles\\". Similar to the concept of a familiar spirit, the Bogle act as \\"protective charms\\" that assist humans in their daily lives. However, some humans want to take advantage of this relationship; Bogles were once large giants in the past, and humans have found a way to transform them into giants again, with the intention of waging wars by using them. As the title suggests, a recurring theme of the game was to be on the evoking of tears, in the context of both sadness and joy. Sakaguchi stated the title was also reflective of his desired response to the game; his goal with the story was to make the player of the game cry themselves. Story The story specifically follows the character Sally, who has the only Bogle in the world that can speak human language. Her father, the King, bestows upon her the ability to transform her Bogle into a giant, and alter its appearance and abilities depending on what other items are connected to it. The player follows Sally as she traverses the countryside with her Bogle, customizing it as she goes, and using it to maneuver through her terrain. Scenarios outlined included situations where only Bogle's abilities could help save people from escaping death, or using Bogle's strength to raise a ship out of water. Gameplay The game would be split between the player controlling two characters: the young human female, Sally, and her giant, Bogle, with emphasis being placed on how differently the terrain would be traversed between the two. In addition to the vast differences in their sizes, Sally's gameplay was to be more based around puzzle-solving and japanese role-playing game-based exploration, while Bogle's gameplay was to be more action-oriented, with him providing all of the game's fighting and battling. For every fifteen minutes of Sally gameplay, the player would control the Bogle for only a single minute. Multiple control schemes were being considered, with one having a dual analogue stick set up, using one for player control and another for pulling, grabbing, and raising objects. Development The game was first announced in December 2005 as the fourth upcoming game being worked on by developer Mistwalker, in addition to Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and ASH: Archaic Sealed Heat. The game would be produced and written by Mistwalker head Hironobu Sakaguchi. He recruited music composer Nobuo Uematsu for the game's music; the two had worked together previously while together at SquareSoft working on Final Fantasy up until the series ninth installment. Uematsu announced rough plans to create the music in the second half of 2006, with Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey's music taking precedence. The game was also announced to be in co-development with another Japanese video game company, Cavia. Most notably, character design would be handled by Kimihiko Fujisaka, who had previously worked on character design in Drakengard. The game on a whole was intended to have a cel shaded art style, though different than much of the cel shaded games on the market at the time, more comparable to the work of a Hayao Miyazaki film. Sakaguchi estimated that the game's creation would require between 1.5 and 2 years of development time. Despite this, 2007 came and went without any further information on the game, and three years after its initial announcement, on December 25, 2008, the game was cancelled, with Mistwalker citing \\"poor economic conditions\\". Some work had been created on the project; Sakaguchi stated that approximately 50% of the game's scenario had been finished. Six years after its cancellation, on December 26, 2014, Sakaguchi released a trailer of the game, without any commentary on it whatsoever. Reception and aftermath Many journalists expressed disappointment in the game's cancellation. Game Informer compared the game's scenario, and general situation of development hell, to Sony's oft- delayed The Last Guardian. Sakaguchi continued to create Japanese role-playing games with Mistwalker and Uematsu, releasing 2012's The Last Story for the Wii and 2014's Terra Battle for iOS and Android.

The town is noted for its production of these figures which generally are carvings of animals painted in bright colors and bold designs, and Angeles grew up carving the local wood they are made from. The artisan‚Äôs work has become distinguished for the painting of fine, intricate designs over the base paint, often inspired by Zapotec and other indigenous designs. He works with his wife Mar√≠a del Carmen Mendoza, at the couple‚Äôs home and workshop in their hometown. While Angeles continues to create alebrijes, much of the production of the workshop is done by younger members of the Angeles family, which is a tourist attraction in the town. Angeles travels frequently to promote alebrijes and Zapotec culture, especially in the United States, and his work has been shown in major venues in Mexico and abroad, as well as featured in two books. In 2014, he was invited to the Vatican to meet Pope Francis and set alebrije nativity scenes and Christmas tree ornaments. Background Angeles demonstrating copal wood and natural paints at his workshop in San Mart√≠n Tilcajete Angeles and his wife Mar√≠a del Carmen Mendoza were both raised in subsistence agricultural families in San Martin Tilcajete, a Zapotec community in the Central Valleys of the state of Oaxaca. In his youth, Jacobo learned to carve wood from his father, and was interested in the twists and turns of copal trees, that lent themselves to alebrije shapes. However Angeles‚Äô father died when the artisan was twelve, requiring him to support the family, which he did, in part, by carving alebrijes. Artistry Angeles‚Äô works and runs his business with wife Mar√≠a del Carmen Mendoza. Jacobo generally carves and paints pieces, and Mar√≠a generally designs, decorates and creates paints from natural materials. Tortoise nahual figure by the artisan His work is distinguished by the carving style but particularly in the way his alebrijes are painted. Like other Oaxacan alebrije makers, the wood is soft copal, in his case collected from the nearby Sierra de Cuicatl√°n, and worked only with hand tools such as machetes, chisels and knives. The carved pieces range from centimeters to meters in length or height. The animals are generally recognizable can include jaguars, dogs, bears, owls and more, often doing something such as flying, scratching itself or fighting. One distinguishing elements in much of Angeles‚Äô work is the appearance of human faces in otherwise animal figures, such as an armadillo with a woman‚Äôs head with braids. This reflects a Mesoamerican belief in nahuals, humans who convert into some kind of animal at night, as well as Jacobo‚Äôs own personal belief that everyone resembles an animal in some way. The painting of his alebrijes is with bright, unnatural color and color combinations, but his works are distinguished with the use of very fine designs over the base coat. Elements in these designs include flowers, plants, geometric designs and indigenous symbols including Zapotec designs with origins in nearby Monte Alban and Mitla. The entire process of making one alebrije, including carving, drying, submersion in gasoline and other chemical to kill insect eggs in the wood and painting averages about a month. Workshop in San Mart√≠n Tilcajete Young artisan painting designs onto a wolf alebrije at the workshop Angeles and his wife Maria still make alebrijes at their workshop which is also their home in San Mart√≠n Tilcajete; however, operations here have grown to include dozens of people and has become a tourist attraction. The site welcomes visitors who can see the processes of carving and paintings as well as demonstrations by Angeles and others about copal wood, carving and natural paints. Most of the production of alebrijes is now done by younger people from San Mart√≠n Tilcajete, mostly relatives of the Angeles family. Their pieces do not command the prices as those done by the master, but they are in a similar style and are similar in quality. Carvers and painters in the workshop sometimes collaborate but generally the painters have license to decorate the figure however they like, much as the carver has license to create using only the branch or trunk as a guide. Recognition Close up of coyote head by the artisan Angeles has become a major figure in the Oaxaca handcraft scene, traveling extensively to promote alebrijes and Zapotec heritage. His work has been exhibited in major national and international exhibitions. He and his work is regularly in the United States, especially in the summer, and his alebrijes have been exhibited in this country in venues such as the Smithsonian Native American Museum and the National Museum of Mexican Art. He is listed as a grand master by the Fomento Cultural Banamex, and his work has been featured in two books Alebrijes. Masterpieces by Jacobo and Mar√≠a √Ångeles (2012) and Cuatro manos, dos oficios. Una iconograf√≠a (2014), along with fellow Oaxacan artisan Carlomagno Pedro Mart√≠nez. In 2014, Angeles, along with other artisans from Oaxaca, was invited to the Vatican to meet the pope and to place 1,200 nativity scene figures and Christmas tree ornaments, which were exhibited at the Vatican Museum. His works can be found in collections in many parts of the world, including those in the United States, India and Japan. His pieces sell for between 2,000 and 30,000 pesos each.

The film is directed by Tollywood line producer Arindam Sil, and produced by Reliance Entertainment and Mundus Services. This is the first installment of Goenda Shabor film series. This is the second directorial venture of the master film director after the blockbuster Aborto The film is based on the investigation of the murder of Mitali Ghosh (Swastika Mukherjee). What follows is a revelation of certain shameful truths that are prevalent in the life of a typical high society person. The film released on 2 January 2015. Plot A police detective Shabor Dasgupta (Saswata Chatterjee) is entrusted with the daunting task of solving the mystery surrounding the murder of Mitali Ghosh (Swastika Mukherjee), a woman with a messy past, who was killed on the night she had thrown a party for friends and family. The task is daunting for Shabor because of the number of people involved. Mitali was once married to Mithu Mitra (Abir Chatterjee), whom she divorced before settling overseas. Though she soon realized how much she loved him, her ego kept her from coming back to him. Heartbroken, Mithu found love in Mitali's cousin Joyeeta (Payel Sarkar). Also involved was Mitali's childhood friend and secret admirer Samiran (Rahul Banerjee), who has relationships with several women, including a school's physical education teacher, Julekha Sharma (June Malia), and another girl, Khonika (Debolina Dutta). Shabor starts investigation with his assistant Nandalal. As Shabor probes deeper, he learns many disturbing secrets about the Ghosh family, including the fact that Mitali had once eloped with a boy from her locality Pantu Haldar (Ritwick Chakraborty). She had married and left him within six months, ruining his future in the process. He was arrested and beaten black and blue by the police who were paid by Mitali's father for the same. Such savage beating resulted in severe nerve damage and erectile dysfunction in Pantu. His career, too, was ruined. Another character, Doel, also comes into the picture. The detective now has to deal with the complex relationship problems that run deep root in the family and the mystery gets more and more complicated. After her father's death, Mitali comes back to Kolkata and stays with Joyeeta's family. Later, Joyeeta reveals that she's dating Mithu. Mitali is heartbroken, and tries to lure Mithu by joining their accounts in vain. In the party, Samiran flirts with Mitali and calls her attractive before a much disgusted Konika. Mitali had confided into Kanika about Mithu and Joyeeta's affair. Meanwhile, when Mitali was in Pondicherry, her father got into a sexual relationship with Julekha and a son was born to them. Julekha was a poor nurse and she started to blackmail him into marrying her but in vain. She even told Mitali about their relation to get a share into his property after his death but was kicked out as a fraud. In that evening before the party, Julekha sneaked in the house with the help of family servant Haren da to steal some money. Unable to provide for her son, Julekha was forced into prostitution, targeting men to earn from. On one such hunts, she came across Pantu; who paid her but could not please her owing to his erectile dysfunction. She insulted him very roughly for that. All the events of the past and Mitali's role in ruining his life flogged Pantu's mind, and a frustrated Pantu thus went and stabbed Mitali six times, saying three were from him and three from Mithu.

Life in Britain  In 1953 he moved to the United Kingdom for postgraduate studies, experiencing and witnessing racism and struggles of ethnic minorities and immigrants in post- War Britain. Hashmi intended to work in a teaching hospital but was told by the British Medical Association that as an immigrant he would never be able to get such a jobDutt's People Profile: Dr Farrukh Hashmi OBE in New Life 4 January 1985 pp2 ‚Äì persevering for three months, he found unpaid attachment at the teaching hospital in Hampstead, in which he proved himself and was offered a paid post as a junior doctor. Later, with the intention to support other doctors and help challenge the discriminatory attitudes of the medical profession, he founded the Overseas Doctor's Association in 1975. Hashmi worked in London hospitals for some time, in both the Royal Free and King‚Äôs College groups, and then in Edinburgh, followed by a 5-year research post at the University of Birmingham in transcultural psychiatry in the British context: mental illness caused or influenced by cultural and/or religious factors, including the effects of migration and racism. It was this work in mental illness through which he became active in the field of race relations, informed by his personal experiences of the events leading to Partition and racial discrimination upon moving to the UK.Griffiths, Joan. 1982 Asian Links. London: Commission for Racial Equality, 1982  Transcultural psychiatry and race relations  As a result of his research in Birmingham, Hashmi acted in an advisory capacity to the UK government for many years: he was made a member of the Race Relations Board in the Home Office (1976-1985) and for this work was appointed an OBE for services to race relations in 1974, contributing to the passing of the Race Relations Act by Parliament in 1976. He was a Commissioner at the Commission for Racial Equality 1980-1986, and a key advisor to the government during the 1981 and 1985 Handsworth riots, highlighting the impact of social divisions and inequality on the individual and community level. His view was that although it would be ideal if racism and discrimination disappeared through integration, education and awareness, sometimes legislation was necessary to encourage and expedite this process.  Support of South Asian arts in Britain  Hashmi‚Äôs interest in scholarship and diversity reached beyond his professional life, and he was active in interfaith work in a voluntary capacity in Birmingham.

Dorgan (November 9, 1921 ‚Äì October 11, 2003) was an American Republican Party politician who served in the New Jersey General Assembly, as Mayor of Palisades Park, New Jersey, and as a member of the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders. Dorgan was born on November 9, 1921 in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, the son of William and Julia Dorgan. He graduated from St. Cecilia High School and attended Seton Hall University.  Biography  William Dorgan served for seven years as the Mayor of Palisades Park (1961 ‚Äì 1967), and for three years as a Bergen County Freeholder (1967 ‚Äì 1969).Fitzgerald's Legislative Manual of New Jersey. Joseph Gribbons. 1971. He was a delegate to the 1968 Republican National Convention and a member of President Richard Nixon's Advisory Council to the General Services Administration. Dorgan was elected to the NJ General Assembly in 1969 but resigned in August 1971 to accept two governor-appointed posts in state government. Governor Cahill named Dorgan to chair the New Jersey Election Law Revision Commission. He also appointed Dorgan to a senior administrative post with the NJ Turnpike Authority. Dorgan returned to the Board of Freeholders in 1973 to fill a mid-term vacancy on the board. He ran for Freeholder again in November 1974 but was defeated. In 1976, Dorgan was appointed Executive Director of the Southeast Morris County Municipal Utilities Authority and retired from the post in 1986. * Nixon nomination - NJ‚Äôs delegation to the 1968 Republican National Convention was expected to back its favorite son, NJ Senator Clifford Case in the first round of balloting. As Nixon gained momentum in the first round, Dorgan was one of 18 delegates urged on by Bergen County GOP Chairman Nelson Gross and State Sen. Frank S. Farley, to cast votes for Nixon instead. NJ was the only delegation to break from a favorite son candidate. The delegation became a significant force and catalyst for Nixon‚Äôs nomination coming on the first ballot. * Voided election - In the 1964 presidential landslide (LBJ over Goldwater), Dorgan was defeated in his bid for a third term as mayor of Palisades Park. Democrat Michael Pollotta‚Äôs victory margin was just 4 votes. Dorgan petitioned the court in a civil case, claiming more than 30 ballots should be disqualified. In a highly publicized trial, Superior Court Judge Morris Malech determined that at least 4 voters who voted for Pollotta were not eligible to vote in Palisades Park. He set aside the election results. Pollotta lost his appeal of the trial court‚Äôs ruling. Thirteen voters were investigated and subsequently indicted by a Bergen County grand jury. In a separate action, Superior Court Judge Gordon H. Brown ordered a special election and an interim mayor was appointed. On August 3, 1965, Dorgan won the special election by a margin of 279 votes. He was sworn in as mayor again on August 16th. The court‚Äôs ruling set a precedent for the state‚Äôs treatment of challenged elections.  New Jersey Assemblyman (1970‚Äì1971)  Dorgan was elected to the NJ General Assembly in November 1969 and served on committees for Federal/State Relations and Taxation, representing East Bergen County. He resigned from the Assembly in mid-1971, accepting appointments to the NJ Turnpike Authority and the NJ Election Law Revision Commission. * Introduced a compromise solution to fund a controversial Rutgers University program for disadvantaged students. ‚ÄúThe Dorgan Bill‚Äù as it became known, was supported by the University, and was passed by both houses of the state legislature * Sponsored a bill that doubled the Bergen County Park Commission debt ceiling from $5 million to $10 million. The bill was especially important for future development of Overpeck County Park and passed in both houses of the state legislature. * Supported legislation to develop the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford * Sponsored a bill to designate Martin Luther King's birthday as a public holiday. (Had it passed, NJ would have been the first state to honor King in this way.)  Bergen County Freeholder (1967‚Äì1969 and 1973‚Äì1974)  Dorgan was elected to a three-year term on the Bergen County Board of Freeholders in 1966. After Republicans regained the majority in November 1967, Dorgan was named Executive Director and led a bipartisan effort to reform the county charter. Ultimately the NJ Assembly failed to approve the changes. He returned as Freeholder, replacing June Clark who resigned from the board in November 1973. In the wake of Watergate, he lost his November 1974 bid for another term. * Secured funding for the opening of Bergen Community College * Phased out tuition fees for Bergen County Technical & Vocational School * Expanded the county's parks and recreational facilities including Overpeck Golf Course, Darlington, Wallington Park, and the Campgaw Ski Area * Created the county's \\"Operation Outdoors\\" summer program for youngsters from low-income families  Palisades Park Mayor (1961‚Äì1967)  Dorgan defeated incumbent Democrat Edward Brown in 1960 and served two consecutive two-year terms. Following a voided election in November 1964, Dorgan won a special election in August 1965. In 1966, he ran a dual candidacy, winning races in both the county and municipal governments. Following an unsuccessful legal challenge by Democrats, Dorgan held freeholder and mayor posts in 1967. Dorgan resigned as mayor on January 1, 1968. * Prioritized construction of a new borough hall complex to house municipal offices, police station, fire station, and the town‚Äôs library. (Completed in 1962) * Proposed plans in 1962 to build the town‚Äôs new high school on the Jabel Park site. (Completed in 1968) * Challenged the county in court in 1965 to gain back property deeded over by the town for the development of Overpeck County Park. Settled out of court in 1969, the county gave the town first-preference access to the new sports complex for Palisades Park High School and 5 acres adjacent to Overpeck for the town‚Äôs new community swimming pool.

One of his major developments was the Theatre Royal, Glasgow which continues today and is owned by Scottish Opera. Baylis was born in Ireland, the son of a bandmaster in the army, and settled in Glasgow with his wife Christina Ferguson Baylis. He worked as a book keeper in a brewery and in evenings and weekends in the late 1840s was the manager of Sloan's Oddfellows Singing Saloon http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/SingingSaloonsSaltmarket.htm, Saltmarket, Glasgow Cross, owned by his brother-in-law (husband of his sister, Mary McBirnie Baylis). He was helped in his variety developments by his brother Sam Baylis who became the noted owner of the Baylis Marionnette Company, most active in England and Ireland.The Theatre Royal: Entertaining a Nation, by Graeme Smith, published 2008 James Baylis determined to have his own music halls and theatres.

Mr and Mrs Baylis set high standards for variety entertainment. In 1875 it was rebuilt, after a fire, to new designs by architects Campbell Douglas and James Sellars. When Christina Baylis died in 1898 it was bought by Moss Empires, created by Edward Moss, and later renamed as The Metropole Theatre http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/Scotia.htm. His third major project was in 1867 when the theatre complex now known as the Theatre Royal, Glasgow opened in Cowcaddens at the corner of Hope Street. It contained the Royal Colosseum & Opera House, where Baylis presented plays, opera, revues and pantomime; and shops, with the smaller Alexandra Music Hall above. Before his death in 1870 he leased the Royal Colosseum to William Glover who had run the older Theatre Royal in Dunlop Street http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/TRDunlop.htm.

History The Hawaii Department of Transportation, during the Lingle Administration, broke ground on the , six-lane highway on February 9, 2005. The highway was completed in three phases. The first phase included the completion of a new overpass to accommodate the new four-lane highway to pass under the H-1 freeway. The second phase built the four-lane highway from Kapolei Parkway up to the junction with Route 7110 and cost more than $12 million.

Life Germanos Mouakkad was born in the beginning of April 1853, son of Issa Mouakkad and his wife Marie Kayata. His parents were Melkites. At his baptism he received the name Joseph. Up to the age of twelve, he attended a Christian school in his home parish, after which he worked as an assistant to a merchant. At sixteen he became--against the fierce resistance of his mother--a novice in the monastery of the Holy Savior, where a monk named Ignace accepted him. After spending some years with Joseph Bakos studying philosophy, he was ordained by Cl√©ment Bahous priest and served as chaplain in Cairo and Damascus. From 1880 to 1886 Mouakkad was Patriarchal Vicar of the Melkite Patriarch of Jerusalem. On 16 March 1886, he received the episcopal ordination and was--now called Germanos--Bishop of the Eparchy of Baalbek. In 1896 Mouakkad received during his stay in Rome by Pope Leo XIII's permission, a medal for missionary priests and in 1903 established a missionary company to priests called Missionary Society of St. Paul (fr) in Harissa, Lebanon. Germanos Mouakkad died on February 11, 1912 in a French hospital in Beirut from the effects of long-term illness. In 2014 a Lebanese stamp was issued with his picture.

It is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. There are shallow and deep- water forms which are structurally different. It forms part of a biodiverse community of rock encrusting organisms and is often parasitised by a barnacle. Description Caryophyllia smithii is a solitary species of coral with a cup-shaped corallum (stony skeleton) with an elliptical base and a diameter of up to . It is usually broader than it is high. The septa (vertical radial calcareous plates) are arranged in four to five cycles and have smooth edges. The column of the polyp can project by up to from the cup and there are about eighty tentacles each with a terminal knob. The polyp is translucent and the colour is variable and may be white, pink, orange, red, brown or bright green. Sometimes there are contrasting regions of colour, especially forming a zig- zag pattern round the mouth. The tentacles are colourless except for the white or brown terminal knobs and the many tiny warts. A form found in deep water is smaller and more delicate; it has an inverse cone shape which is narrowed at the base, while shallow water forms are cylindrical and more robust. Distribution and habitat Caryophyllia smithii is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean as far north as the Shetland Islands, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The shallow water form occurs from the sublittoral zone down to about . The deep water form occurs from about down to about , generally in less turbulent waters than the more robust shallow water form. Sometimes its narrow base becomes detached from the substrate and it lives free on the seabed. This coral is abundant around the west coasts of the British Isles below the Laminaria zone and may occur at densities of over 100 per square metre below the red algae zone, being found both on flat rock and in crevices. Ecology In natural habitat The habitat of Caryophyllia smithii is often dominated by sponges and bryozoans and these also grow on the corallum of the coral. The larvae of the barnacle Megatrema anglicum often settle near the rim of the corallum where they appear to be immune to the coral's nematocysts. They become attached to the stony material and the coral's epithelium overgrows them except for their operculums. A single coral may be colonised by multiple barnacles and these have a tendency to aggregate on one particular part of the coral, often the lower side when corals are growing on vertical surfaces. The presence of these barnacles is semi- parasitic as the coral's tentacles retract when they come into contact with the barnacle's cirri (feeding appendages), and this hampers its food-gathering activities.

City of Boston Archives Izzy Ort's Bar & Grille was a live music venue located at 25 Essex Street in Boston, Massachusetts. History Izzy Ort's was open from 1935 to 1969. Originally it featured jazz musicians. In 1953, the owner renamed it the Golden Nugget and switched to hillbilly music, and later, rock. Musicians played on two floors: in the main room at street level, and in a room upstairs called El Tropico. Izzy Ort's was one of the first strip bars in what would later become known as Boston's Combat Zone. As a popular hangout for sailors, it was notorious among musicians for being a rough place to play. Like the Silver Dollar, it was patronized by both heterosexual and gay men. The bar was owned by Isadore \\"Izzy\\" Ort (1893 - 1975), a reputed former bootlegger from New York City who moved to Boston in the early thirties. Ort, who left school after the fourth grade, was known in Boston as a colorful character who settled disputes among his patrons with a metal flashlight. He also had a reputation for generosity to servicemen. Anyone in the service who was away from home on Thanksgiving or Christmas would be served a free turkey dinner at Izzy Ort's. In the early 1940s, Ort bought space in the Boston Record-American for a regular column of his own, titled \\"I Wuz Thinkin.\\" The column was accompanied by a picture of Ort wearing his characteristic fedora and smoking a cigar. 25 Essex Street later became part of Hong Lok House, an affordable housing project for Chinatown's elderly residents. Notable performers Many notable jazz musicians played at Izzy Ort's in the 1940s and early 1950s. Quincy Jones played there in the early 1950s while attending the Berklee College of Music. Although he recalled it as \\"a real dive,\\" he noted that two musicians he worked with there, pianist Preston Sandiford and alto player Bunny Campbell, were influential in his musical development. His friend Buddy Catlett said in a 1993 interview that Jones didn't become a good soloist until he began working at Izzy Ort's. The great baritone saxophonist, Serge Chaloff, performed there when he was just fourteen. His brother Richard Chaloff remembered: 'He didn't have a permit to work but he was pretty tall and he went down to see Izzy Ort...and played for him and Izzy liked the sax...and he hired my brother to work nights....My mother used to pray on Sundays that that he'd make it outa there....My brother sat in with bandsmen that were in their thirties and forties...and here he was fourteen, fifteen years old and he played right along with them, and he did so well that they kept him.' Alto saxophonist Charlie Mariano also played at Izzy Ort's in his youth. According to Mariano, the bar had an upstairs band, which was white, and a downstairs band, which was black. Mariano started working upstairs, but when the alto player downstairs joined the Coast Guard, the black band hired him. \\"That was a fantastic experience,\\" he said, \\"because they were playing the music I loved - Duke Ellington, [Jimmie] Lunceford, Basie.\\" Jazz trumpeter Ruby Braff, who considered Izzy Ort's \\"particularly notorious,\\" played there as a teenager. Jazz critic Nat Hentoff recalled sneaking into Izzy Ort's (\\"a terrible joint\\") as a youth to see the 15-year-old Braff perform. That night Benny Goodman, who had been playing at the RKO Theater next door, was drawn to Izzy Ort's by the sound of Braff's playing. Goodman asked Braff to join him on the road, but the boy's mother insisted he finish high school. Other musicians who played there include Sam Rivers (\\"You'd get the Navy and the Marines in there, and they could destroy the place in five minutes\\"), Hal Galper (\\"The safest place was on the bandstand\\"),, Dick Johnson, Jaki Byard, Roy Haynes, Nat Pierce, Herb Pomeroy, Dick Twardzik, and Larry Willis. Popular entertainer Sammy Davis, Jr., who lived for several years in Boston's South End, reminisced years later about \\"hoofing and singing\\" at Izzy Ort's. Eddie Cantor and Jimmy Durante, friends of Ort's from his New York days, often dropped by to visit when they were in Boston. In 1964, evangelist Billy Graham made headlines when he addressed the crowd at Izzy Ort's, inviting them to a gospel lecture he was giving later that night at Boston Garden. Alyce Mills Johnson, a former dancer with Cab Calloway's orchestra, was Izzy Ort's first black entertainer. She worked as an emcee at Izzy Ort's from 1938 to 1941. In a 1977 interview, Johnson recalled Ort fondly, saying, \\"He was a fine and generous man.\\" See also * Playland Caf√© References External links * \\"Oh Max\\" - Robert Creeley's memorial poem for Max Finstein, which mentions Izzy Ort's * \\"Izzy Ort's, 1955\\" - a painting by the English artist Edward Burra * \\"Ort's Golden Nugget\\" and \\"3 am, Ort's Golden Nugget\\" by photographer Jerry Berndt Category:Culture of Boston Category:Music venues in Boston Category:Nightclubs in Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Boston Category:Former music venues in the United States Category:Drinking establishments in Boston Category:Jazz clubs in Boston ","title":"Izzy Ort's Bar &amp; Grille"},{"id":"44904749","text":"Sir Nilesh Jayantilal Samani (born 19 July 1956) is a British physician who is professor of Cardiology at the University of Leicester, and consultant cardiologist at Glenfield Hospital in the city.

She has led the revival of interest in Franz Xaver von Sch√∂nwerth, the 19th-century folklorist who collected fairy tales in the Upper Palatinate region of northern Bavaria, having found 500 tales of his in the municipal archives of Regensburg, most of which had never been published before. She is a writer, a poet, an authority on the folk heritage of the Upper Palatinate, and a well-known storyteller.See Franz Xaver von Sch√∂nwerth Society website, Erika Eichenseer biography section: www.schoenwerth.de/.../Symposium_Biogs.www.schoenwerth.de/.../Symposium_Biogs Life Erika Eichenseer completed her schooling in Erding in 1952. She then trained as a primary school teacher, graduated in 1954 at the Teachers‚Äô Training College of Freising. She subsequently studied English and German, graduating in 1959 as a teacher for secondary modern schools. She married Adolf J. Eichenseer the same year. From 1959‚Äì1979 she taught in secondary schools in Munich and later in Regensburg, where she initiated school theatre projects, for which she wrote plays and adapted local tales, including some by Sch√∂nwerth.http://www.schoenwerth.de/.../Symposium_Biogs From 1979 to 1994 she worked in her husband's institute for the development of traditional culture (Bezirksheimatpflegeamt Oberpfalz), specializing in regional literature, documentation and the reanimation of traditional customs and arts. In this function she guided 400 amateur theatre groups in the region, giving them specialized courses, reviewing the value of their performance material, created opportunities for new plays to be written, and wrote plays herself. For twenty years, until her retirement in 1994, she produced and directed children's theatrical productions at the instrument-making courses in Pleystein and Waldm√ºnchen. For ten years she was involved in the children's theatre at Burg Wolfsegg, producing texts and directing productions.See Neuer Tag, 10.1.1976 In 1976 the Eichenseers were invited to the US to the German Department of the University of Missouri to speak about their work. In 1977 they took part in a University summer programme there on traditional folk instruments. Erika Eichenseer lectured on puppet plays and participated in the German Department's folklore course. In 1995 they took part in the Missouri Big Muddy Folk Festival with lectures and story-telling.Ozarks Missouri, 3 April 1995 p. 7. To commemorate the centenary of the death of Franz Xaver von Sch√∂nwerth in 1986, Erika Eichenseer produced a booklet of his tales, complete with a teachers‚Äô manual, for all schools in the Upper Palatinate; she helped to arrange a Sch√∂nwerth exhibition and a theatrical production which travelled to eight different locations in Bavaria, she opening and introducing each one. In 2009, she came across around 500 unpublished Sch√∂nwerth tales in the Municipal Archive of Regensburg. She selected and edited 136 of them for her book Prinz Rosszwifl (Prince Dungbeetle), which was published the following year. In 2010, Eichenseer and her husband founded the Franz Xaver von Sch√∂nwerth Society.http://www.schoenwerth.de/ She produced a further Sch√∂nwerth reader with a teachers‚Äô manual for all schools in the Upper Palatinate. During the centenary year the Society organised a whole series of commemorations, Erika Eichenseer herself lectured, spoke and performed at about 100 events.http://www.schoenwerth.de/events In March 2012 Eichenseer's book Prinz Rosszwifl was reviewed by Victoria Sussens-Messerer in the English newspaper The Guardian and the discovery of 500 new Sch√∂nwerth fairytales hailed as a sensation.Sussens-Messerer, Victoria: \\"500 new fairy tales discovered in Germany\\", The Guardian 05 03 2012 This led to considerable international interest. Penguin Classics decided to publish a collection of Sch√∂nwerth tales in English ‚Äì in February 2015 ‚Äì and translations into other languages may follow.http://www.schoenwerth.de/aktivitaeten- projekte/schoenwerth-international/ In 2012 an annual Sch√∂nwerth Day was inaugurated at the Open Air Museum in Neusath-Perschen. \\"Don‚Äôt read to us, Grandma ‚Äì tell us stories!\\" was the theme of a fairy tale seminar and gala evening. This was followed by story-telling in the International Children's and Young People's Library in Munich.See See Neuer Tag, 18 Oct 2012, p. 45. In June 2013 Erika Eichenseer took part in a 2-day symposium organised by the School of Education in Trinity College Dublin on \\"The Role of Fairy Tale in Contemporary Theatre\\".See Trinity College Dublin School of Education Newsletter, Summer 2014, p. 7 and Symposium 2013 ‚Äì Erika Eichenseer ‚Äì YouTube The premiere of the musical based on Sch√∂nwerth's tale Das Fliegende K√§stchen (The Flying Trunk) was given on 7 July 2013 in Regensburg. The idea and libretto were by Eichenseer, the music by Mathias Wehr; the work was performed by the Cantemus Choir of Regensburg and conducted by Matthias Schlier, and was directed by Gregor Turecek. It was part of the Schaulust Festival Junges Theater Regensburg.See Das Fliegende K√§stchen programme of 7 July 2013.

As described in an obituary for The Telegraph, Paniguian was a long-time troubleshooter and project manager for British Petroleum in some of its most challenging territories. He was also notable for his involvement in negotiating the release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the Libyan convicted in 2001 of organising the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. Early life Paniguian (middle, second right) as a student participant in a cricket match held at Durham School Paniguian's father, Hracia, known to friends as 'Pan', was a leading figure in British intelligence, a veteran of the Special Operations Executive, and an expert in psychological warfare who eventually settled into a career in advertising. He had been born in Constantinople in 1903 during the last years of the Ottoman Empire; the family name was of Armenian origin. Hracia was sent to school at Robert College and studied journalism at Columbia University, where he was friends with A. J. Liebling. In the 1930s he worked under Reginald Hoare at the British Embassy in Bucharest. The Panaguian household in South Kensington, within easy reach of several embassies, was a discreet meeting place for Hracia's French, north African, Greek and Middle Eastern contacts during and after the Second World War. It was also within walking distance of the Natural History Museum and Royal Albert Hall, and the young Richard often went boating in the lake of the nearby Regent's Park. Novelist Jim Powell was a childhood friend. He also had one sister, Helen. He was schooled at The Hampshire School, Chelsea followed by Westminster, then read for a degree in Arabic at Durham University. At Durham he was a member of Hatfield College and also played rugby union 'of the coarsest variety' alongside the future Air Marshal Peter Walker for the University 4th XV. He served as Treasurer of Hatfield College JCR in 1968 and graduated with a 2:1 degree in 1971. Career 1971‚Äì1980 After university he joined British Petroleum in 1971 as a graduate trainee in the oil trading division, and spent the first years of his career in Oman and then Dubai. He relocated to Iran in 1978, where his position as commercial representative in Tehran proved increasingly tricky with the outbreak of the Iranian Revolution. In response, he added a moustache to his 'swarthy complexion' so he could walk the streets inconspicuously. This, however, did not save him from being briefly arrested after he was found in possession of a transistor radio. 1980‚Äì2008 Moving to America in 1980, and going on to become Vice-President of International Oil Trading in New York City, he eventually served as President of BP Turkey from 1989 until 1992. He was then appointed director of BP Europe until 1995, CEO of BP Shipping until 1999, and then BP's Vice-President for the Middle East. In this role he was much occupied with the construction of the Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìCeyhan pipeline ‚Äì the world's longest ‚Äì across Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. On the eve of the Iraq War, he was to be found in Whitehall corridors arguing for a foothold for BP and other UK oil companies in post-conflict Iraq, amid rumours that the Americans were offering oil deals to France and Russia to secure their support for the war. In 2002, he became Group Vice-President for BP as a whole, where he stayed until his left the firm in 2008. 2008‚Äì2017 Paniguian in 2011 On his retirement from BP in 2008, Paniguian became head of the Defence and Security Organisation (DSO) within UK Trade and Investment, working alongside defence manufacturers in their export sales efforts. While nominally part of UKTI (now the Department for International Trade) he actually reported to the Ministry of Defence. This role made him one of the highest paid civil servants in the United Kingdom, earning a salary between ¬£195,000-¬£199,000. The release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi in 2009, demanded by Colonel Gaddafi in return for BP oil contracts and counter-terrorism assistance, meant Paniguian was well placed to answer requests from the Libyan Government for arms and military training. A month later, he gave a speech noting that 'high-level political interventions' had enhanced the prospect of arms sales to Libya. BP would later admit to pushing for the release of al- Megrahi. Under his stewardship DSO achieved a record of ¬£13 billion in sales in 2013. Paniguian retired from his job with DSO in February 2015. The following year he joined the board of defence giant Raytheon. Personal Sir Richard was married to Lady Paniguian (Nil Okan) JP FCIL (Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Linguists), and had two stepsons, Emir and Efe.

Distinguishing Features Niebla podetiaforma is distinguished by the thallus divided into small tufts of yellowish-green, tubular-inflated, branches not more than 5 cm high, the branches usually less than 20 in number, erect to spreading and curved, occasionally divided into similar branches, or more often fringed along the upper side with shorter branches or lobes that bear apothecia, and by containing the lichen substance divaricatic acid, with triterpenes, and with yellow pigments concentrated at the base. The cortex is relatively thin, 25‚Äì50 ¬µm thick, covering a fistulose (hollow) medulla. Similar species are Niebla turgida, which differs by the bushy growth (larger thallus with more than 20 branches) with long tapered branches, Niebla undulata, distinguished by the recessed cortical surface between the cortical ridges, Niebla rugosa that differs by the ladder-like transverse cortical ridges between branch margins, and Niebla contorta that is recognized by the terminal rounded lobes thickened along margins, usually with submarginal apothecia; all contain divaricatic acid and less inflated branches. A sekikaic-acid species, Niebla siphonoloba, often recognized by the simple branches with a closely reticulate cortex similar to a honeycomb, occasionally has less conspicuous reticulate ridging that may be confused with N. podetiaforma; this form is more easily distinguished by its secondary lichen metabolite (sekikaic acid). Niebla podetiaforma is a common lichen of coastal pebble lichen communities in the Northern Vizca√≠no Desert of Baja California.Niebla and Vermilacinia Communities, Richard W. Spjut, World Botanical Associates, retrieved 30 Dec 2014; http://www.worldbotanical.com/niebla_communities.htm It often occurs on leeward slopes, and on mesas more inland from the coast than other species of Niebla. This adaptation undoubtedly is related to the thin cortex and hollow medulla, which probably account for bloated appearance of the branches. Rare thalli have a flattened appearance as if someone had stepped on them, but can be identified N. podetiaforma by the fine reticulate pattern of cortical ridges. Divaricatic-acid species of Niebla are generally distinguished by cortical features, in contrast to branching patterns in salazinic-acid species, and apothecial developmental patterns in sekikaic-acid species, with exceptions that require application of other morphological characters. Taxonomic History Niebla podetiaforma was recognized by Richard Spjut as a distinct species from Niebla homalea based on samples that he and Richard Marin had collected for anti-HIV screening in Baja California, 29 April 1985,(Spjut & Marin 9077),Samples of lichens were collected from the eastern and western regions of the United States and Baja California, Mexico during 1985 for anti-HIV screening. Lichens were considered a potential novel source for new anti-HIV drugs since they had rarely been collected for the NCI antitumor screening program. Richard Spjut, the Senior Partner of WBA, proposed that the NCI reduce their 1 kg quantity to 25 grams in order to obtain a broad diversity of lichen samples. The NCI group maintains an inventory of natural product extracts with details on the collection data. Voucher specimens are deposited at the United States National Herbarium (Smithsonian Institution) and cited in Spjut's 1996 revision of the genus. about 35 miles north Guerrero Negro on ridges and leeward slopes above San Andr√©s Ranch. On the day before they collected samples of Niebla homalea on Punta Banda and Niebla flagelliforma (initially identified as Niebla sp. undescribed) near Rosarito just north of Guerrero Negro. A sample of approximately 100 grams of N. podetiaforma was to be sent to the National Cancer Institute, Natural Products Branch for their drug screening program in the search for new compounds to treat HIV and cancer; but instead the collected thalli were used as exsiccati that were distributed 11 years later to other institutions through the ABLS Lichen ExchangeABLS Lichen Exchange, retrieved 21 Dec 2014, http://mlbean.byu.edu/lichenexchange/Home.aspx The species was described in 1996.

Frenn set world bests in the outdoor and indoor weight throws, won two medals in the Pan American Games and competed in the 1972 Summer Olympics. Track and field career Frenn took up track and field in 1957 at North Hollywood High School, initially competing as a runner rather than a thrower. He got interested in hammer throwing in 1959 after seeing Olympic champion and world record holder Hal Connolly throw in a local meet. He improved rapidly, placing sixth at the 1962 NCAA championships with 169 ft 7 in (51.68 m); in that meet, he represented Abilene Christian University, a school he only briefly attended. In 1963 he showed good form from the early spring and placed second behind defending champion Al Hall at the national (AAU) championships, throwing 198 ft 10 in (60.60 m); Track & Field News ranked him the third-best American that year, behind Connolly and Hall. Nevertheless, he failed to gain selection either to the Pan American Games or the dual meet against the Soviet Union in Moscow. Frenn suffered an injury in April 1964 and lost his best form; he returned to the NCAA championships, this time throwing for Long Beach State, but again only placed sixth. He slipped from third to ninth in the United States and failed to qualify for the 1964 Summer Olympics, although with the emergence of Ed Burke as a third top thrower alongside Hall and Connolly, making the Olympic team would in any case have required Frenn to improve his personal best considerably. In 1965 Frenn placed third behind Connolly and Burke at the national championships, throwing 210 ft 2 in (64.05 m), and regained his ranking as #3 in the United States. Frenn injured his back in training in August 1965, and then his leg just before the 1966 national indoor championships, where he would have competed in the 35-lb weight throw. At the 1966 outdoor championships Frenn only threw 199 ft 5 in (60.78 m) and placed fourth. By 1967, the outdoor 56-lb weight throw had become an obscure event; it rarely featured in meets, had only been contested once at the AAU national championships after 1959, and the International Amateur Athletic Federation didn't ratify official world records in it. Nevertheless, Frenn took it up that year after a friend mailed him a free weight; in his first competition with the outdoor weight he threw 45 ft in (13.98 m), which would have broken Bob Backus's world best of 45 ft 2 in (13.76 m) from 1957, but his implement was found to have been slightly too light. Later that year he legitimately broke the record at the Rose Bowl Invitational, smashing Backus's mark with a throw of 48 ft in (14.64 m). Frenn also improved in the hammer, throwing 220 ft 11 in (67.33 m) in Sacramento on June 10 for a new personal best; at the national championships he threw 213 ft 7 in (65.10 m) and placed second as the winner, Burke, set a new American record of 235 ft 11 in (71.91 m). Frenn was selected for the 1967 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, where he placed third with a throw of 64.08 m (210 ft 3 in) as fellow American Tom Gage won gold. In 1968 Frenn placed second at the national championships with a throw of 214 ft 11 in (65.50 m), but at the Olympic Trials, which were held separately, he only managed 210 ft 1 in (64.03 m) and missed out in fourth place as Burke, Hall and Connolly qualified for the team for the second consecutive Olympics. In November, after the Olympics, Frenn improved his personal best to 226 ft 6 in (69.04 m) in Long Beach. In 1969 Frenn threw the 35-pound indoor weight 73 ft in (22.33 m) to beat Connolly's world best from 1960; he also broke his own world best in the 56-pound weight throw that year, improving to 49 ft 7 in (15.11 m). In the hammer, Frenn placed second in the AAU meet for the third consecutive year; despite throwing 227 ft 2 in (69.24 m), he still lost to Gage by a foot and three inches. Nevertheless, Track & Field News ranked him the #1 hammer thrower in the United States for the first time, ahead of Connolly and Gage. Frenn won his first national track and field championship title (he had previously become national champion in powerlifting) at the 1970 AAU indoor championships, throwing the 35-pound weight 70 ft in (21.47 m) to beat Connolly, Gage and Hall. That summer he also won his first national title in the hammer throw, throwing 230 feet (70.10 m) and beating Gage by a foot and seven inches; in practice before the championships he reportedly threw 248 feet (75.59 m), which would have been a world record if duplicated in competition. His best in official meets was 232 ft 7 in (70.89 m), which he reached in Berkeley on May 30; that mark was then the third-best by an American, and would remain his career best. He appeared on the cover of the Sports Illustrated's July 6, 1970 issue. In 1971 Frenn repeated as national champion in both the hammer and the indoor weight and was ranked the #1 hammer thrower in the United States for the third consecutive year; in the indoor weight, he broke Connolly's meeting record from the 1960 championships with his throw of 71 ft 4 in (21.74 m). He also broke his own world best in the outdoor weight for a final time, reaching 49 ft in (15.15 m). At the 1971 Pan American Games in Cali he won silver in the hammer with a throw of 65.68 m (215 ft in), losing to Hall by only six and a half inches. In 1972 he won his third consecutive title in the indoor weight, breaking his championship record from the previous year with a throw of 72 ft 4 in (22.04 m). Later that winter he threw 74 ft in (22.62 m) in a dual meet against the Soviet Union to break his own world record. That summer Frenn finally qualified for his first Olympics, albeit narrowly; with his throw of 224 ft 7 in (68.46 m), he placed third at the 1972 Olympic Trials and got the last spot on the team behind Gage and Al Schoterman. At the Olympics in Munich he only reached 62.14 m (203 ft 10 in), placing 27th in the qualification round and failing to qualify for the final. Frenn's results in the hammer started slipping after 1972, and he never placed in the top three at the national outdoor championships again, although in 1973 he was still ranked second in the country despite only placing sixth in the AAU meet. He remained a top weight thrower, however; between 1970 and 1977 he won six indoor national titles, only missing out in 1974 (when he was the best American but lost to France's Jacques Accambray) and in 1976, when he was a close second behind Larry Hart. In 1975, he competed as a hammer thrower in his third Pan American Games, but only placed seventh with a throw of 63.22 m (207 ft 4 in). He announced his retirement from track and field after the 1980 national indoor championships. Other sports Frenn was also a good powerlifter, although he mostly approached that sport as training for hammer throwing; consequently, he concentrated on the squat and deadlift more than the bench press, as bench press was less good for his throws. In 1967 he became the first national powerlifting champion in the 242 lb (110 kg) weight class despite the runners-up comfortably beating him in the bench press. Frenn helped promote powerlifting and challenged the authority of Bob Hoffman in the sport; with Joe Weider, Frenn organized one of the first international powerlifting meets, a competition between American and British lifters, in 1970 despite opposition from Hoffman. Frenn competed in the first World's Strongest Man contest in 1977, but placed eighth and last. Later life Frenn worked as a high school teacher in California for thirty-two years. Frenn worked at Cerritos High School in Cerritos, California where he was both a weightlifting coach (Physical Education) and science teacher. In 1982 he helped his friend Tom Waddell promote the inaugural Gay Olympics in San Francisco and carried the torch into the stadium during the opening ceremonies; he also competed in the meet, winning gold in the hammer throw. Frenn, who was not homosexual, later regretted this, as being mistaken for gay interfered with his teaching and social relationships. Frenn died in Sacramento, California on June 26, 2006.

The districts were drawn first to achieve a population balance (districts were drawn to be within +/- 4% of each other), and then to be as geographically compact as possible. Many districts included parts of several counties. Some districts had more than one incumbent. Essex County was part of five legislative Districts: District 25 The predominantly Essex County- based 25th District included parts of suburban Western Essex County, as well as two towns in Morris County and Wayne in Passaic County.

He was lord of Lochawe and Ardscotnish from 1316 until his death sometime before 1343. Life Colin was the oldest son of Sir Neil Campbell and his first wife, likely Alyse Crawford. His stepmother was Mary Bruce, sister of king Robert the Bruce. It has been theorized that Cailean of Carrick was Colin's great-great grandfather, which would also make Robert the Bruce his second cousin once removed. Tradition has it that William Wallace's mother was Margaret Crawford, which if accurate, would make Wallace and Colin first cousins once removed. In 1316, shortly after his father's death, Colin was granted the entirety of Lochawe and Ardscotnish (lands along the shore of Loch Awe) as a free barony by Robert the Bruce. In exchange for this, Colin agreed to provide troops for Robert's army and a single 40-oared ship when requested. He served in Robert's army during the Irish campaign of 1315-1318. The Brus relates a tale from this campaign in which Colin disobeyed Robert's orders and charged a pair of English archers. While Colin killed the first archer, the second killed Colin's horse. Robert himself intervened, riding to Colin and hitting him with a truncheon as punishment. During the reign of Edward Balliol, Colin sided with David II. Amidst the struggle, Dunoon Castle was captured by a force led by members of the Campbell clan, possibly Colin, and has remained held by the family ever since (though mostly in ruins today).  Marriage and issue  Colin married a woman named Helena. Ane Accompt of the Genealogie of the Campbells identifies her as the daughter of John More and associates her with the Earldom of Lennox.

Her funeral oration was delivered by William Penn. Biography Rebecca Travers was born in 1609, the daughter of a Baptist named Booth, and studied the Bible from the age of six. At an early age she married William Travers, a tobacconist at the Three Feathers, Watling Street, London. In 1654 curiosity led her to hear a dispute between James Nayler and the Baptists. Soon afterwards she met Nayler privately, became a Quaker and his friend. Her stability and discretion contrasted, according to the Dictionary of National Biography, with the extravagances of the handful of Quaker women who contributed to Nayler's fall. Rebecca Travers visited him in prison, and upon his release in September 1659, lodged him for a time at her house. A fearless and powerful preacher, Travers attended St John the Evangelist's church in the same year and questioned the priest on his doctrine. He hurried away, leaving her to be jostled and abused. John Gough says she was three times in Newgate Prison in 1664, but these imprisonments are not recorded in Besse's Sufferings. She was early taking a prominent part among Quaker women, being trusted especially with care of the sick, poor and prisoners. She visited prisons at Ipswich and elsewhere. In 1671, a year before the representative yearly meeting, the \\"six weeks' meeting\\" was established as a court of appeal composed of \\"ancient Friends\\" ‚Äî i. e. old in experience and Quaker standing, not age. Rebecca Travers was one of its first members. The \\"box meeting\\" for the relief of poor Friends was initiated at her house, where George Fox was a frequent visitor. She is described as the most prolific Quaker after Margaret Fell. Rebecca Travers died on 15 June 1688, aged 79. Her funeral oration was delivered by William Penn.Oration by William Penn, Quaker Pages A son, Matthew, and at least one daughter survived her.

It flows through Meƒëimurje County. Geography and hydrography The river is 46,9 km (29,14 mi) long and its watershed drains an area of about 250 km2 (96,5 sq.mi). It has its source at an elevation of 300 meters near the village of Vukanovec in the Gornji Mihaljevec municipality, which is situated in the hilly, northwestern part of the County. The upper course of the river flows southwards, then turns by the village of Macinec to the east. It flows further as a slow-moving plain stream, mouthing into the Mura. The river mouth is located near the village of Goriƒçan at an elevation of 140 meters. Trnava is incorporated into the water retention ponds' and irrigation canal network of Meƒëimurje County. Water level of the river can fluctuate throughout the year, being occasionally very low during periods of drought and sometimes extremely high after heavier rains. Throughout its course, Trnava receives the waters of many tributaries (most of them coming from the left side, like Dragoslavec, Goriƒçica, Ple≈°kovec, Knezovec, Hrebec, Brezje, Bo≈°ƒçak, Mur≈°ƒçak, Korenatica, and a few of them from the right side, like Kopenec and Sratka), becomes wider, deeper and slower, and finally empties into the Mura. Along its banks is a chain of villages (Gornji Mihaljevec, Macinec, Nedeli≈°ƒáe, Pribislavec, ≈†tefanec, Mala Subotica, Palovec, Strelec, Dr≈æimurec, Turƒçi≈°ƒáe) as well as the town of ƒåakovec, the County seat. History In the past, Trnava was a left tributary of the Drava River, but following the occasional changes of watercourses of the Drava and Mura in many centuries ago (due to flooding) it was cut through by Mura, becoming the latter's right tributary. The lower course of the river still exists today and is called Stara Trnava (=Old Trnava), being incorporated into the Bistrec-Rakovnica water canal network, which empties into the Drava east of Donja Dubrava. During past centuries Trnava was important for filling up the moats around the Zrinski Castle in ƒåakovec. In the first half of the 20th century the river was not yet properly regulated and this often led to flooding. The last serious flood in ƒåakovec occurred on 12 March 1963. Since then the river banks have been reconstructed and raised, so that flooding stopped.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Bot. Misc. 14 The epithet, pulchribarbara, is in reference to the strikingly beautiful lichen mat formed by the thallus. Distinguishing Features Niebla pulchribarbara is distinguished by a hemispherical mat-like thallus, divided into numerous tangled sublinear-prismatic branchesLinear: having parallel margins 10 times or more longer than wide. Prismatic: appearing like a prism in cross section of a branch to 8 cm high and 16 cm across, and by containing the lichen substance protocetraric acid, without triterepenes. The species (N. pulchribarbara) is known only from two locations in Baja California: (1) growing on stony ground on a mesa above San Antonio del Mar, and (2) growing on sand at Bah√≠a de San Quint√≠n. Taxonomic History Niebla pulchribarbara was described by Phillip Rundel and Peter Bowler as a result of conducting an ecological study of a lichen fog community at Bah√≠a de San Quint√≠n in March 1971.Rundel P., P. A. Bowler and T. W. Mulroy. 1972. A fog-induced lichen community in northwestern Baja California, with two new species of Desmazieria The Bryologist 75: 501‚Äì508. They distinguished the species in the genus Desmazieria that was later determined to be illegitimate (later homonym for a genus of grass Desmazeria) and they replaced it by a new name, Niebla.Rundel, P.W. and P.A. Bowler, 1978. Niebla, a new generic name for Desmazieria (Ramalinaceae). Mycotaxon 6: 497‚Äì499 They distinguished Niebla pulchribarbara from Niebla homalea and also from one other new species they described (Niebla josecuervoi) by the medulla reaction to para-phenylenediamine, depsidones (pd+), depsides (pd-), while they also selected a different chemotype for each holotype (biology), protocetraric acid for N. pulchribarbara, salazinic acid for N. josecuervoi; however, the two new species were distinguished by the habit of the thallus, saxicolous with branches connected to a basal holdfast (N. josecuervoi), and terricolous, lying loose on sand (N. pulchribarbara). Richard Spjut distinguished the two species by their lichen substances and branching patterns that resulted in describing two more terricolous species with salazinic acid in order to clarify their taxonomy; Niebla effusa was recognized by terminal dilated and fringed branches, and Niebla arenaria by the antler-like terminal branches. Niebla pulchribarbara is easily recognized by its secondary metabolite, the only species in the genus to contain protocetraric acid. Only four specimens of Niebla pulchribarbara were cited by Spjut in his taxonomic revision of Niebla. Three are at the United States National Herbarium (Smithsonian Institution, Museum of Natural History, Department of Botany) of which two were collected by Spjut from a mesa above San Antonio del Mar, 25 March 1988 (accompanied by Daniel Norris) and 13 April 1990 (accompanied by Richard Marin); the third was from Bah√≠a de San Quint√≠n, the type locality; it was collected by Velva E.

Although Niebla pulchribarbara was considered distinct from N. josecuervoi by Rundel and Bowler when they described the species in 1972, Bowler and Janet Marsh in 2004 decided they were no longer distinct; N. pulchribarbara was included under a broad species concept of N. josecuervoi in the Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert.Bowler, P. and J.

History The first section of the Merthyr, Tredegar and Abergavenny Railway from Abergavenny to was opened on 29 September 1862. The line was leased and operated by the London and North Western Railway which acquired the smaller railway company on 30 June 1866. On 1 March 1864, the line was extended from Brynmawr to . Trevil opened with the extension of the line on 1 March 1864. The village had a long association with tramroads, the Trevil Rail Road having been established in May 1793 and operating from 1797. The Sirhowy Tramroad ran southwards to Sirhowy Ironworks. The Rassa Railroad ran from Trevil limestone quarries to the north-east, under the Merthyr and Abergavenny line, and to the Beaufort Ironworks. Originally, constructed to , it was converted to gauge to link with the Sirhowy Tramroad. The works and five collieries comprising of private mineral lines were purchased by Richard Thomas & Co. in 1935. Trevil station was in an isolated location, situated just to the south of the Castle Inn. It had two platforms, the main brick-built station building and house being situated on the Down platform. No goods yard was provided but parcels were handled and private sidings were provided in connection with the Beaufort Ironworks which ran parallel with the Sirhowy Tramway. These sidings lasted until May 1938. At the same time, the station's signal box was replaced by a frame in the bay window of the station house in order to maintain the block post. A few years earlier, in , the station had been downgraded to a railway halt. As a result of decline in the local industry and the costs of working the line between Abergavenny and Merthyr, passenger services ended on 4 January 1958. The last public service over the line was an SLS railtour on 5 January 1958 hauled by GWR 6959 No. 7912 Little Linford Hall. Official closure came on 6 January. Present The site of the station has been lost under the A465 road.

It is situated on a north facing slope on the Madron to Morvah road. The nearest town is Penzance to the south. Toponymy Lanyon derives from Lyn yeyn in the Cornish language meaning cold pool. It has been previously written as Liniein, Leniein, Lenien (all three in 1214), Linyeine (1244), Lenyen (1285), Lynyeyn (1326), Lanyayn (1443) and Lennyen (1447). In 1878, Wayfarer in The Cornishman, and in 1880 William Bottrell states the name was pronounced as La- nine and Lanine respectively. The Lanyon surname originates from the hamlet and there are places in the parishes of Gwinear and Illogan where the name was taken by a branch of the family. History There is evidence of neolithic occupation of the area with the nearby megalithic tombs of Lanyon Quoit and West Lanyon Quoit, both within . In the same field as West Lanyon Quoit is Old Lanyon, a deserted medieval farmstead dating from around 1050 AD and abandoned in the late 15th or early 16th century. Old Lanyon was a detached part of the Domesday manor of Binnerton in Crowan parish. From the 13th century through to the 18th century it was the home of the family which took its name from the sub-manor. The vicar of Madron was licensed by the Bishop of Exeter to take services in the Chapel of the Blessed Mary of Laneyn; the first instance of Lan in Lanyon. A field next to the present settlement is named Park-an-Chapel suggesting that by 1390 the main settlement was at, or near the present buildings. In 1879 Lanyon Farm was owned by Jonathan Rashleigh. Rashleigh, was summoned to the West Penwith Petty Sessions at Penzance on 9 July 1879 for having four unfenced shafts belonging to an old abandoned mine on the farm. It was found that Mr Rashleigh was not to blame but was fined 5 s for each shaft and 20 s expenses.

Cause The incident began at about 23:35 local time on New Year's Eve. The crush centered on a stairway leading up to a viewing platform overlooking the river. Some people were trying to climb to the platform while others were trying to go down, causing panic and confusion. People standing on the steps to the viewing platform began to fall down the stairs, collapsing into each other. There were reports that a planned New Year's light show had been canceled at the last minute and that the crowd control measures required for such a show were not in place. Rumors of cash coupons Early reports stated that people were throwing cash coupons resembling U.S. dollars into the crowd. One of the victims stated that cash coupons were thrown onto the street from a bar and that several of the people had rushed to grab them. However, the Shanghai police later denied social media reports that the stampede was triggered by people stopping to pick up coupons, saying that \\"video footage showed that the bills had been thrown after the crush took place\\". An 18-year- old witness told news portal Sina: \\"I've seen people saying that the stampede happened because people were throwing fake money. But I don't think that's the main reason ‚Äî there was so much distance, there's no way the money could have blown over to the viewing platform.\\" Rescue Site near the stampede on 1 January A girl mourning for the victims At approximately 23:50, people started to realize the danger and began to retreat from the crowd. The police at the scene also started to instruct people to evacuate from the second level. At 23:55, police and citizens had formed a wall to make way for ambulances. The injured were then sent to local hospitals. After the accident, the government of Shanghai formed a working group to coordinate the rescue, led by mayor Yang Xiong. The identities of all victims have been confirmed, according to the local government. The youngest victim was 12 years old. As a result of the stampede, similar New Year celebration events on December 31, 2015 were cancelled. Response Central government President and General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang ordered the Shanghai government to \\"go all out\\" in its rescue efforts. On January 1, Xi and Li called for an immediate investigation into the source of the accident. Xi Jinping also said a profound lesson should be learned from the incident. Shanghai government The local government cancelled all New Year celebration activities on January 1, including the New Year's marathon and Shanghai Tower light show. Guyi Garden, Fangta Garden and Yu Garden's Lantern Festival were also cancelled. On the morning of the 1st, citizens mourned for the victims at the Bund.

However, the crowd was no smaller than in previous years, possibly because a scaled-down version of the light show was being held at different venue with a similar name.

It took place in University City, Missouri from 1968 to 1990. One of its leading investors was Leo Drey. His wife, Kay Drey, was its chief spokesperson. The UCHRT bought houses in a part of the city into which African Americans were moving, as whites were moving out. The houses were rented to white families with school-age children. The goal was to keep the neighborhood and the local public school integrated. In 1979, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said, \\"The project--which experts say may be the only one of its kind in the United States--appears to have promoted integration successfully.\\" William Freivogel, \\"Novel Trust Promotes Integration, But White Steering May Be Illegal.\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Aug. 1, 1979, p. 9A  University City  University City, an old inner suburb of St. Louis, had an almost entirely white population until 1960.NiNi Harris, Legacy of Lions: a History of University City, p.156.

Elected officials and community leaders decided to make integration of the city their goal, said then-City Manager Charles Henry.Charles T. Henry, A History of Community Sustainability, p.3 Historical Society of University City, 2012 They felt that they were making an effort that was long overdue. Kay Drey wrote that in America up to that time, once blacks started to move into a community, it would remain integrated only for as long as it took for all the whites to move out.Kay Drey, \\"Background Information for the Formation of the University City Home Rental Trust\\" n.d.p.1. Drey, Kay, Queeny Park Collection, State Historical Society of Missouri archives  The Trust  The idea for the trust came from Rev. William G. Lorenz of the University City Human Relations Commission.Freivogel, \\"Novel Trust\\" He said that in the area around Pershing Elementary School, white homeowners had reached a stage of \\"incipient run-away panic.\\" Lorenz, W.G., \\"A Problem--Its Solution\\" p. 6. 1968. Drey, Kay Queeny Park Collection and that something unusual would need to be done to draw whites to the area and keep the school integrated. He believed that young,well-educated, growing, \\"highly-mobile\\" families were seeking to rent quality houses and that the marketplace was not meeting this demand. He further asserted that many of these people were enlightened enough in racial attitudes to move into a mixed neighborhood, provided they were renting and not buying. Drey said that renters did not need to fear declining resale value, a key driver of white flight by homeowners.Kay Drey, \\"Background Information\\" In March 1968, the Trust was formed by the Dreys, Janet Becker, Alan Kohn, and other investors.Letter from W.G. Lorenz to J. Becker, March 4, 1968. Drey, Kay Queeny Park Collection By August, it had bought and renovated nine houses in northeastern University City. By September 1969, it owned 20 houses, all rented.Minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting of the UCHRT, Sept. 1969. Drey, Kay, Queeny Park Collection But the trust experienced problems. It operated at a loss for its first year.Minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting of the UCHRT, Sept. 1969. Drey, Kay, Queeny Park Collection. Attracting more investors was difficult \\"because of our controversial nature.\\" Minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting of the UCHRT, Dec. 1969. Drey, Kay, Queeny Park Collection. The Executive Committee sought to make it clear that they were not trying to keep African Americans out. Kohn said that he spoke to a neighborhood meeting of 50 people, about half of whom were black, and that they were \\"relieved and enthusiastic about what we were doing.\\"Minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting of the UCHRT, Sept. 11, 1968. Drey, Kay, Queeny Park Collection. To fulfill its purpose, the UCHRT needed white families with children of age to attend the public school in its houses. Recruiting suitable tenants was its most persistent problem. When working with a commercial real estate firm, the UCHRT found that it tended to send them African American clients.Minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting of the UCHRT, Dec. 1971. Drey, Kay, Queeny Park Collection. It was necessary to use the University City Residential Service, a non-profit office co-founded by the Dreys, to find white applicants. But one white couple threatened to sue, charging that the UCHRT discriminated against families without school-age children.Minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting of the UCHRT, April 1969.

But by 1977, all the houses were rented.Memo to Members of the Executive Committee from Zelda Epstein, May 21, 1977. Drey, Kay, Queeny Park Collection. Lorenz was proven correct about the sort of people who would be willing to rent from the UCHRT. In 1970, nine of 22 tenants were junior faculty or other employees of nearby Washington University. Five more worked at other universities. In interviews, many tenants said they were satisfied with the neighborhood and school and felt they were doing something good for the city.Minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting of the UCHRT, April 1970. Drey, Kay, Queeny Park Collection. In 1979, the UCHRT owned 35 houses, which would turn out to be the maximum. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch took notice of its activities. Reporter Freivogel said that the UCRS did not tell blacks about UCHRT houses, instead steering them to white neighborhoods, which might be a violation of the Fair Housing Act. Some activists denounced the UCHRT's investors as over-reaching, arrogant whites. But after interviewing residents of the Pershing neighborhood, Freivogel reported some praise and no complaints from black residents about the trust's role in keeping the area integrated.Freivogel, \\"Novel Trust\\" In a later analytical piece, Freivogel applied the then-current term \\"integration maintenance\\" to the UCHRT's activities. Integration maintenance was \\"pioneered in University City and suburbs of Chicago\\" and had spread to other large metropolitan areas, but it remained controversial.\\"Helping Integration: a Suburban Dilemma.\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Aug. 26, 1979, p.6  Winding Up of the Trust  In the mid '80s the UCHRT began to wind up. Its investors felt that it had served its purpose. By 1984, the Trust had sold nine of its houses.

Only one was completed and that was soon abandoned. Design and development The SO.3050 was designed in occupied France during World War II and was the first French two seat tourer to fly after the Liberation. It was a conventional low wing cantilever monoplane, powered by a Renault 4Pei air- cooled inverted four cylinder inline engine. Pilot and passenger sat side by side under multipart glazing which ran rearwards into the raised upper fuselage. This raised region dropped away towards the tail, where the tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage. The vertical tail was straight edged but with a broad rounded top and a curved fillet to merge it into the fuselage.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Bot. Misc. 14 The epithet, ramosissima, is in reference to the very much branched thallus. Distinguishing Features Niebla ramosissima is distinguished by a mat-like, flaccid thallus, very much divided into numerous tangled narrow sublinear-prismatic branchesLinear: having parallel margins 10 or more times longer than wide. Prismatic: shaped like a prism in cross section of branches to 16 cm across, the individual branches only 0.5‚Äì1.0 mm in diameter, and by containing divaricatic acid, with triterepenes. Niebla juncosa, a species with the same chemistry and similarly shaped branches, which occurs on the Baja California peninsula, differs by its turgid thallus with larger branches, 2‚Äì5 mm in diameter, and further differs in their spreading to erect habit and in their elliptical shape in cross section. Taxonomic History Niebla ramosissima was recognized as a result of undertaking a taxonomic revision of the genus in regard to developing a lichen flora of Baja California, which began in 1986. A peer review of the manuscript in 1990 suggested that additional herbarium collections be studied, especially of Niebla on the California mainland and in the Channel Islands. Additional specimens were studied through loans obtained by the United States National Herbarium (Smithsonian Institution, Museum of Natural History, Botany Department)United States National Herbarium, http://botany.si.edu/colls/collections_overview.htm from the University of Colorado at Boulder and from the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. Niebla ramossisima was discovered among the borrowed specimens (of Niebla). The species is known only from the holotype (biology). It was collected by Charis Bratt, 12 February 1993. Niebla ramosissima has also been included under an extremely broad interpretation of Niebla homalea based on the assumptions that morphological variation in Niebla is environmentally induced and that chemical variation represents chemo-syndrome variation;Bowler, P. and J.

Born in Virginia, Beverley‚Äîthe son of planter and historian Robert Beverley, Jr. (c. 1667‚Äì1722) and his wife, Ursula Byrd Beverley (1681‚Äì1698)‚Äîwas the scion of two prominent Virginia families. He was the nephew of Peter Beverley (1668‚Äì1728), Speaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses, and the grandson of wealthy Virginia planter William Byrd I (1652‚Äì1704) of Westover Plantation. Beverley's mother died shortly before her 17th birthday (when he was a toddler), and he was sent to England. After his education in England he began a career in public service as the Clerk of Court for Essex County (1716‚Äì1745) and in the Virginia House of Burgesses, representing Orange (1736‚Äì1738) and Essex Counties (1742‚Äì1749). Beverley also served on the Virginia Governor's Council in 1750. He inherited a large estate after his father's death in 1722, amassing significant landholdings throughout Virginia from which he received revenue from tobacco production and rent from 119 tenants. His development of the Beverley Manor tract in present-day Augusta County encouraged further settlement west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Beverley was commissioned by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, for an expedition with Peter Jefferson to establish the Fairfax Line of the Northern Neck Proprietary.  Early life and education  Beverley was born in 1696, the only child of Robert Beverley, Jr. (c. 1667‚Äì1722) and his wife, Ursula Byrd Beverley (1681‚Äì1698). Robert Beverley, Jr., of the Beverley Park plantation in King and Queen County, was a wealthy planter who participated in the Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition and was the first native-born historian of colonial Virginia; he wrote the History of the Present State of Virginia in 1705, the first known history of Virginia. William Beverley's uncle, Peter (1668‚Äì1728), was Speaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses. His mother, the daughter of William Byrd I (1652‚Äì1704) and Maria Horsmanden Byrd of Westover Plantation, was affectionately known as \\"Little Nutty\\" by her family. She died on October 31, 1698, shortly before her 17th birthday, and was buried in Jamestown. Through his paternal grandmother, Margaret Boyd Beverley, William Beverley was a great-grandson of Scottish noble James Boyd, 9th Lord Boyd (died 1654). After his mother's death Beverley was sent to England, where he was educated.  Political career  After his education was completed, Beverley returned to Virginia and began a career in public service. He was the Clerk of Court for Essex County for 29 years (1716‚Äì1745), when the first Essex County courthouse was on Beverley's Blandfield estate. Beverley was also an Essex County judge from 1720 to 1740. He was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses in Williamsburg, elected to represent Orange (1736‚Äì1738) and Essex Counties (1742‚Äì1749). During his first term as Orange County burgess, Beverley served with Robert Green. He represented Essex County with James Ganett until 1747, after which he served with William Daingerfield until 1749. Beverley's appointment as county lieutenant and commander-in-chief of the militias of Augusta and Orange Counties in 1741 was confirmed in the Orange County Court on November 3, 1741. In 1750 he was appointed to the Virginia Governor's Council, the upper house of Virginia's colonial legislature, replacing John Custis IV (father-in-law of Martha Dandridge Custis). Beverley's appointment to the Governor's Council fulfilled an ambition which his father was unable to achieve.  Agricultural pursuits and landholdings  Beverley's son, Robert, built the mansion at Blandfield between 1769 and 1773. The property was owned by the Beverley family from 1683 until its 1983 sale. Beverley inherited a large estate after his father's death in 1722, and continued speculating in land. He received income from tobacco production and rent from tenant farmers. Although by 1745 Beverley's estate produced 57 hogsheads (about 26,000 kg) of tobacco, the income from his 119 tenants in Caroline, Culpeper, Orange and King and Queen Counties was far more lucrative. After his marriage to Elizabeth Bland about 1725 Beverley lived at Blandfield, a estate along the Rappahannock River in Saint Anne's Parish of Essex County which he named for his wife's family. Blandfield was granted by patent to his grandfather, Robert Beverley, Sr., in 1683 as part of a tract. Construction of Beverley's first, Georgian-style mansion at Blandfield (which is no longer standing) probably began around 1750. Blandfield had wharves on the Rappahannock from which the plantation's tobacco was shipped across the Atlantic. In addition to agriculture and land tenancy, Beverley received additional revenue from land sales in western Virginia. The easing of restrictive land laws by the Virginia colonial government allowed him to establish his own terms with settlers on his lands, and he initially sold parcels in the Shenandoah Valley. On September 6, 1736, Beverley, John and Richard Randolph and John Robinson were deeded a land patent by Sir William Gooch, 1st Baronet on behalf of the crown for a tract at the headwaters of the South Fork Shenandoah River in present-day Augusta County. On September 16 the Randolphs and Robinson transferred sole ownership of the tract to Beverley, who planned to survey and sell it; the tract, which became known as Beverley Manor, encouraged further settlement west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. He commissioned James Patton, a ship captain from Ulster, to recruit Irish and Scotch-Irish immigrants to purchase and settle his Augusta County land. On August 8, 1737, Beverley wrote to Patton, \\"I should be very glad if you could import families enough to take the whole off from our hands at a reasonable price and tho' the order mentions families from Pensilvania [sic], yet families from Ireland will do as well\\". In 1738 he authorized John Lewis of northern Ireland, the father of Thomas Lewis, to show and sell his land in Augusta County and donated a lot in Staunton for the construction of the Augusta County Courthouse ten years later. By 1743 Beverley wished to receive a land grant of in the Northern Neck Proprietary on the Shenandoah and the South Branch Potomac rivers from Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, planning to raise horses and cattle and divide the Northern Neck land for tenants. He and others, including John Robinson and his father (also named John), purchased on the Greenbrier River in 1745 for speculation and settlement. Beverley's land sales totaled by 1744, and by his death in 1756 he had sold and made a profit of ¬£2,647. According to his 1756 will, Beverley owned land in Essex, Isle of Wight, King and Queen and Prince William Counties; in Caroline County, including the Pewmazeno and Beverley Chace properties and land lots in Port Royal; a land tract of , known as Elkwood, in Culpeper County, and lots in the towns of Falmouth and Fredericksburg. According to historian Turk McCleskey, the land grants to Beverley from the Governor's Council on behalf of the crown \\"reflected the Council's recognition both of his elite connections and of his demonstrated leadership abilities\\".  Business pursuits  Beverley owned and operated a tavern at Caroline Court House in Caroline County, and participated in trade with the West Indies. He wrote to a Barbadian merchant in 1739, \\"I am very conveniently situated for the sale of Negroes, rum, sugar & Mollasses [sic]\\". Beverley sold Barbadian salt in Virginia and shipped Virginia maize to Barbados. A partial inventory of his estate in 1745 listed 65 slaves on four plantations, cattle, hogs, sheep and horses. In 1763 Beverley's son, Robert, reported that his father's estate earned \\"about ¬£1800 Currency, all plantation expenses deducted\\".  Fairfax Line expedition  In 1746 Beverley was commissioned by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, to represent him in an expedition with Peter Jefferson (father of Thomas Jefferson) through western Virginia to mark the Fairfax Line of the Northern Neck Proprietary, supervising the work of Jefferson and the other surveyors. The following year, he and the other participants in the Fairfax Line expedition reconvened at Jefferson's Tuckahoe plantation to draft a map (which became known as the Fry-Jefferson Map) of the Northern Neck Proprietary.  Personal life and family  Beverley married Elizabeth Bland (born May 26, 1706) around 1725. Elizabeth was the daughter of Richard Bland and Elizabeth Randolph Bland of Jordan's Point, and the sister of statesman Richard Bland. Beverley and his wife had four children: one son and three daughters‚ÄîRobert Beverley (1740‚Äì1800), Elizabeth Beverley Mills, Ursula Beverley Fitzhugh and Anna Beverley. Beverley took an active role in his children's education, traveling to England in 1750 to enroll his son, his nephew Robert Munford III and another young man at Wakefield Grammar School. Three of Beverley's children married into prominent Virginia families. Robert married Maria Carter, daughter of Landon Carter and Maria Byrd Carter of Sabine Hall, Richmond County. Elizabeth married James Mills, a merchant in Hobbs Hole, and Ursula married William Fitzhugh. Anna was unmarried at Beverley's death in 1756. Beverley, an Anglican, had a close relationship with Anglican minister and parson Robert Rose of Saint Anne's Parish. Blandfield was in the parish, and his family attended Anglican (and later Episcopal) services at a church near the estate. On April 3, 1750 Beverley provided a lot in Staunton for the Anglican Augusta Parish Church, which was completed in 1763 and succeeded by the present Trinity Episcopal Church.  Death and legacy  After Beverley's death in 1756, his son Robert was his designated heir at law. His wife Elizabeth inherited his plantations in Essex County, including the Blandfield estate and his \\"slaves, cattle, horses, hogs, and sheep\\" on the plantations. Beverley divided a large part of his fortune among his children and their spouses, bequeathing ¬£500 to his daughter Elizabeth and leaving her husband, James Mills, \\"Money & slaves\\" valued at ¬£1,000. Ursula also received ¬£500 and her husband, William Fitzhugh, ¬£1,000. Anna was unmarried at the time of Beverley's death; his will instructed Robert to maintain his sister until her marriage or her twenty-first birthday, when she would receive her inheritance. Robert inherited the remainder of the plantations and other lands, including the Beverley Manor tract in Augusta County and lots in the town of Staunton. Beverley Manor, an Augusta County magisterial district south of Staunton, is a namesake of the Beverley Manor patent. After his mother's death Robert also inherited Beverley's Essex County properties, including Blandfield (where he built the present Georgian mansion on the site of his father's residence between 1769 and 1773).

Hopkins (born February 7, 1954) is an American philosopher. He is an Associate Member of the University of Lille, UMR-CNRS 8163 STL, Permanent Faculty member of the Summer School of Phenomenology and Phenomenological Philosophy, Ca‚ÄôFoscari University of Venice, former Professor and Chair of Philosophy at Seattle University Seattle University (1989-2016) and Permanent Secretary of the Husserl Circle. Husserl Circle. He has been Visiting Professor at the University of Nanjing, China (2013), Visiting Professor at The School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS) and the Koyr√© Center, Paris, France (2015-17), Senior Fellow at The Sidney M. Edelstein Center for the History and Philosophy of Science, Technology and Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem (2018), and most recently Researcher at The Institute of Philosophy, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, The Capital, Czech Republic (2019-2020). Biography Hopkins earned his BA in Philosophy from Allegheny College in Pennsylvania under the direction of James F. Sheridan, his MA in Philosophy at Ohio University under the direction of Algis Mickunas, and his Ph.D. in Philosophy from DePaul University in Chicago under the direction of Parvis Emad. He is founding co-editor (with Steven Crowell) of The New Yearbook for Phenomenology and Phenomenological Philosophy. Academic work Hopkins is best known for his work on Husserl and Jacob Klein, although he has also published on Plato, Kant, Heidegger, and Derrida. His 1993 book Intentionality in Husserl and Heidegger: The Problem of the Original Method and Phenomenon of Phenomenology defends the philosophical superiority of Husserl‚Äôs transcendental phenomenological method over Heidegger‚Äôs hermeneutical refashioning of phenomenology‚Äôs method. Hopkins‚Äôs general argument is that Heidegger‚Äôs hermeneutical critique of Husserl‚Äôs reflective phenomenology of consciousness presupposes the structures of Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology that are the targets of that critique. According to WorldCat, the book is held in 147 libraries. His 2010 book The Philosophy of Husserl presents a defense of Husserl‚Äôs transcendental phenomenology from the critiques of Heidegger and Derrida. It does so by challenging their common claim that Husserl‚Äôs thought is historically determined by the limits of Greek ontology and metaphysics. According to WorldCat, the book is held in 232 libraries. His 2011 book, The Origin of the Logic of Symbolic Mathematics: Edmund Husserl and Jacob Klein, compares Klein‚Äôs largely overlooked Greek Mathematics and the Origin of Algebra (1934 and 1936) with Husserl‚Äôs concern to provide a philosophical foundation for the formalization of logic and mathematics.

History The first section of the Merthyr, Tredegar and Abergavenny Railway from Abergavenny to was opened on 29 September 1862. The line was leased and operated by the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR;) which acquired the smaller railway company on 30 June 1866. On 1 March 1864, the line was extended from Brynmawr to . A further extension to Rhymney Bridge through to was jointly constructed by the L&NWR; and the Rhymney Railway; the section to Rhymney Bridge was double-track whilst the Rhymney portion was single-track. The joint line came into operation on 5 September 1871 when the junction was opened; the L&NWR; had running powers over the Rhymney's line to Cardiff Docks. The station, which was at first known as Rumney Bridge, opened to Rhymney services on 2 October 1871 and to L&NWR; services on 1 January 1873. It took its name from the bridge over the River Rhymney which was situated a short distance to the south-east; the nearest settlement was the village of Llechrhyd. The station had three platform faces and, as with the junction at Nantybwch, the signal box stood in the \\"V\\" of an island platform. The two platforms serving the Abergavenny and Merthyr line had no passenger accommodation, although a brick station building stood on the Merthyr platform. This structure has been described as \\"resembling a peasant's dwelling from the bleak wastes of northern China\\". Rhymney Bridge itself was situated in a desolate location, with scant protection from the inclement weather provided by a weather-boarded footbridge linking the platforms. The Rhymney branch platform was situated at a lower level to the main line platforms and was skirted by two goods loops which were useful for slow-moving goods trains. As a result of decline in the local industry and the costs of working the line between Abergavenny and Merthyr, passenger services ended on 4 January 1958. Services on the Rhymney branch had ceased on 23 September 1953 and goods facilities were withdrawn from Rhymney Bridge on 22 November 1954. The last public service over the Merthyr line was an SLS railtour on 5 January 1958 hauled by GWR 6959 No. 7912 Little Linford Hall and L&NWR; Coal Tank No. 58926. At Rhymney Bridge, a laurel wreath was placed on the smokebox door of No. 58926. Official closure came on 6 January. Present The site of the station has been lost under the A465 road. The branch to Rhymney has been obliterated by the A469 road.

However, he played only two matches in 1950 before poor form and injury ended his first- class career. Coaching career Taylor did \\"prove a great asset\\" though. While trying to recover from a shoulder injury in 1951 he began informally coaching some of the county's young players. He showed such aptitude for coaching the young that Warwickshire employed him as a coach until he retired in 1981. The cricket journalist Rowland Ryder regarded him as \\"probably the best coach of the under-18 age group in the country\\"; Taylor had \\"an infinite capacity to understand the adolescent mind\\".Rowland Ryder, Cricket Calling, Faber & Faber, London, 1995, p. 126. He was \\"a tremendous believer in natural ability and [showed] unlimited patience\\" with young players.

To mark his 25 years as coach, Warwickshire awarded him a testimonial in 1976. After he retired, he returned to Jamaica in 1982, but his health declined and he died in 1987.

A demob suit was a suit of civilian clothes given to a man on his demobilisation from the British armed forces at the end of the Second World War. Although the suits were of good quality, the need to clothe millions of demobilising servicemen led to supply problems that caused some men to receive suits that were not of the correct size. As a result, the demob suit became a common subject in British comedy in the post-war years.  Etymology  The word \\"demob\\", short for demobilisation, came into use in the 1930s. Soldiers had received a set of civilian clothes on demobilisation at the end of the First World War, however, the phrase \\"demob suit\\" only came into common use at the end of the Second World War.\\"demob suit\\" Collins Dictionaries. Retrieved 3 January 2015.  Background  Beginning on 18 June 1945, millions of men were demobilised from the British armed services on a phased basis according to age and length of service. A set of civilian clothes was essential in order to help them integrate into civilian life and because they normally no longer had their original clothes after years in uniform. Clothes rationing meant that it was not possible to buy a new suit from a shop without a large quantity of ration coupons and a long delay while the suit was made. Many separate demobilisation centres were run by the Army, Navy and Air Force, alongside Civilian Clothing Depots. Army centres were run by the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. One air force centre was at Uxbridge.  The suit  Some servicemen complained that their suit made them look like old-time gangsters. At the demobilisation centre, men exchanged their service uniform for civilian clothes. The demob suit was just one part of a complete set of clothes. According to the Imperial War Museum, the full outfit included:Jacket, civilian (Demob suit). Imperial War Museum. Retrieved 31 December 2014. *A felt hat or optional flat cap. *A double- breasted pinstripe three-piece suit, or a single-breasted jacket with flannel trousers. *Two shirts with matching collar studs. *A tie. *Shoes. *A raincoat. A variety of other items are sometimes said to have been supplied, the list varying according to the source, including gloves, underwear, socks, and bowler hats. In addition, men were given a special allocation of clothing coupons with which to buy any extra items they might need, a special cigarette ration, and a one-way rail warrant. Men could keep their service uniform too and many left the distribution centres in uniform with a small suitcase containing their demob clothes. Towards the end of 1945, around 75,000 demob suits were being made each week. One of the principal suppliers was Burtons, founded by Montague Burton,Burtons Demob Suit. BBC, 2010. Retrieved 4 January 2014. leading to speculation that the phrase the full monty, meaning \\"everything\\" or \\"a complete set\\", originated in reference to a full set of demob clothes supplied by the firm.\\"The Full Monty\\" The Phrase Finder. Retrieved 4 January 2014.\\"monty\\" Oxford Dictionaries. Retrieved 4 January 2014. Other manufacturers included the Fifty Shilling Tailors and Simpsons of Piccadilly. Demob suits were made of the best quality material available in quantity at the time and were not utility clothes. However, problems with distribution meant that the right sizes were not always in stock when the clothes were fitted and the style of what was available was not always what men wanted. These problems made the demob suit the butt of much ridicule and humour. One soldier described his trousers as \\"unfriendly\\", saying \\"they kept their distance from my feet, in mourning at half mast\\". Another complained that his suit \\"looked as hostile and intimidating as the bloke pushing it my way\\". Men took pot luck with what was available when their turn came. Sometimes only unusual sizes were available, although being a particularly difficult size could be an advantage as then a bespoke suit was ordered and delivered by mail which might be a better fit than one of the off-the-peg suits. The fact that certain versions were very common and easily recognised made some men feel that they had substituted one uniform for another. One remembered that he \\"walked proudly into town wearing my light grey pin-striped demob suit, looking around, I recognized all the ex-servicemen ‚Äì they were all back in uniform ‚Äì light grey pin-striped suits!\\" Others were embarrassed to wear the suits. One reported that he rarely wore his to work as \\"both the pattern and the hue made it difficult to hide its patriotic origins\\". Nonetheless, the suits were often the first that a man had owned and they remained in use for many years after the end of the war, being brought out whenever formal wear was required, such as at Christenings or weddings.  Black market sales  Clothes rationing meant that there was plenty of demand for the suits and the other items on the black market. Spivs (small time criminals dealing in illicit goods) lurked outside distribution centres and offered men ¬£10 for each set of clothes, which some accepted. Questions were asked in Parliament but the government could do nothing as the clothes belonged to the ex-servicemen as soon as they signed for them.

Anthony Powell, who had a successful military career during the war and may have gone through the process himself, used a scene set in the demob centre at Olympia as the conclusion to his 1968 novel The Military Philosophers, \\"Rank on rank, as far as the eye could scan, hung flannel trousers and tweed coats, drab mackintoshes and grey suits with a white line running through the material\\", asking whether the massed ranks of empty coats on their hangers somehow symbolised the dead.Powell, Anthony. (1991) The Military Philosophers. London: Arrow, pp. 241‚Äì242  In comedy  The demob suit became a popular subject in British comedy after the Second World War as a topic to which millions of people could relate. There was obvious comic potential in a suit that was either too large or too small. The British physical comedian Norman Wisdom, whose suits were always too tight and who had been demobilised himself in 1946, was described by one critic as \\"Pagliacci in a demob suit\\". An obituary of Wisdom spoke of his \\"ill-fitting, half-mast demob suit\\".\\"Norman Wisdom: Tribute to a Comedy Legend\\" Andrew Collins, Sabotage Times, 5 October 2010. Retrieved 6 January 2015. Frankie Howerd, one of a whole generation of British comedians who started their career immediately after demobilisation, performed in a badly fitting demob suit, probably because he had nothing else to wear.

The design incorporated a 57 mm gun M1, a US production of the British Ordnance QF 6 pounder, mounted on an M3 Half-track. A total of 962 vehicles were produced from 1942 to 1943. It had originally been planned that Britain would receive all of the examples produced through Lend-Lease, intending to use them in the Western Desert, but by the time they arrived the campaign was over. Additionally, the purpose-built M10 tank destroyer, armed with a 3-inch gun (and later a 17-pounder gun in British service) had begun to enter production. As a result, the British transferred 650 half-tracks to the Soviet Union under the Soviet Aid Program. Britain retained 30 and the remainder were taken by the US; except for one kept by the U.S. Army, these British and American vehicles were converted back to standard M3 Half-tracks. The Soviets called it the SU-57 (Samokhodnaya ustanovka 57); under this designation it served in Operation Bagration and other fighting on the Eastern Front during World War II.  Specifications  The T48 Gun Motor Carriage was long, wide, and high. It had a wheelbase of , and weighed 9.45 tons (20,800 lb).Berndt (1993), p. 152. The suspension consisted of a leaf spring for the wheels, while the front tread had vertical volute springs. The vehicle had a maximum speed of . With a fuel capacity of 60 US gallons (230 l), it had a range of , and was powered by a Berndt (1994), p. 34.

It also had 6‚Äì12 mm of armor, and was armed with a single 57 mm Gun M1 with 99 rounds of ammunition. It had a crew of five (commander, gunner, driver, loader, and radio operator).Doyle (2013), pp. 227‚Äì228  Development  T48 in the Polish Army Museum The T48 originated from an Anglo-American requirement for a self-propelled 6-pounder anti-tank gun.Chamberlain & Ellis (1969), p. 191. The requirement was met by emplacing a 57 mm gun M1 ‚Äì the U.S. production version of the British Ordnance QF 6-pounder ‚Äì in the rear of an M3 Half-track. The first production batch was ordered in April 1942. The Americans dropped their requirements because of the design of another tank destroyer, the M10.Zaloga (2012), pp. 4‚Äì5. Afterwards, it was intended solely to be supplied overseas under the terms of the Lend- Lease Program; the T48 was never officially type-classified.Zaloga (2004), pp. 35‚Äì36.  Pilot model  The pilot model was built at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in May 1942. The 57 mm Gun M1 was mounted in the M12 recoil mechanism and installed on a tubular pedestal. The tubular pedestal was soon replaced with a conical structure that was designated the \\"57 mm gun mount T5\\". The gun on the pilot model had a traverse of 27.5 degrees either side of the centerline (total of 55 degrees), while having an elevation of +15 to -5 degrees. The short-barrelled (43 caliber) British Mark III 6-pounder gun was installed in the pilot, but the longer-barrelled (50 caliber) 57 mm Gun M1 was specified for the production models. The original travel lock ‚Äì to hold the gun in a fixed position when the vehicle was moving ‚Äì proved to be unsatisfactory, and was replaced by a travel lock on the front hood.Mesko (1996), p. 24. The original design used a gun shield taken from the T44 57 mm Gun Motor Carriage, but after the first tests were complete, a new shield was designed with face-hardened steel 5/8 inch thick on the front and 1/4 inch thick on the sides and top. The shield extended over the crew with a relatively low silhouette of only .Hunnicutt (2001), pp. 106‚Äì107 Experience with the M3 Gun Motor Carriage in the Philippines Campaign, resulted in demountable headlights being used.Hunnicutt (2001), p. 98.Mesko (1996), p. 22. The T48 was accepted for production in 1942.  Service history  A T48 in the Kubinka tank museum. Deliveries of the T48 were made in 1942 and 1943, with 50 arriving in 1942 followed by a further 912 in 1943. The British ordered all of the T48s that were produced, intending to use them in the Western Desert Campaign. By the time the vehicles arrived in the theater in the summer of 1943, the British had already won the war in the Western Desert. Meanwhile, the 57 mm gun was superseded by the 75 mm gun from the U.S., and later the availability of the Ordnance QF 17-pounder gun, meant that the T48 became surplus to British requirements. As a result, the vehicles were almost immediately shipped to the Soviet Union under the terms of the Soviet Aid Program. Through this, the Soviets received 650 vehicles, which they designated the \\"SU-57\\" (Samokhodnaya ustanovka 57). A small number were later passed to the Polish People's Army.Kinard (2007), p. 297.Green (2014), p. 214. Of the remainder, Britain accepted 30, all of which were converted back into carriers, and the US took 282 vehicles. Of those retained by the US, all but one were converted back to M3A1 standard carriersRottman (2012), p. 30. in 1944. The conversion took place at the Chester Tank Depot.Hunnicutt (2001), p. 109. The Wehrmacht also operated a number of T48s as carriers, having captured several from Britain and the Soviet Union. The Soviets employed the T48 along the Eastern Front, mainly in Operation Bagration. The Soviet 16th Separate Tank Destroyer Brigade used a large number of T48s in 1943 during the offensive across the Dnieper River, and with the 19th Brigade during the Baranow bridgehead battle in August 1944. The T48 also served with the Soviet 22nd Self-Propelled Artillery Brigade. Some of these units also took part in the Berlin and Prague offensives. The Polish People's Army used T48s assigned to the 7th Self-Propelled Artillery Battery to support Soviet attacks into Germany and Poland.Zaloga (1994), p. 36. In Soviet service, the vehicles were allocated to brigades at a scale of 60 per brigade. During the attack, the vehicles were used to provide mobile fire support, being placed behind the infantry, usually in a hull-down position behind a ridge or a hill, to fire across a broad front to take advantage of the long range of the 57 mm gun.Dunn (1995), pp. 85‚Äì86  Operators  * British Army accepted 30 vehicles, later rebuilt as carriers. * Polish Army in the East received 15 vehicles operated previously by the Red Army. * Red Army operated T48 GMC under the designation SU-57.Green (2013) * U.S. Army used T48s rebuilt as M3A1 Half-tracks, in 1944.Ness (2002), p. 193.

It is a Looney Tunes cartoon, featuring Bosko, the first star of the series. It was released in January 1931, although some sourcesMaltin, Leonard. Of Mice and Magic: a History of American Animated Cartoons. Von Hoffmann Press, Inc., 1980. p. 404 give an unspecified date in 1930. It was, like most Looney Tunes of the time, directed by Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising; Frank Marsales was the musical director. Summary The iris opens to Mounted Police headquarters in a snowstorm. Within, we find the Sergeant, a pipe in his mouth, pacing the floor and occasionally spitting tobacco at a coal stove. He hears a knock at the door, and opens it for Bosko, the hero of the picture. Blown in by the wind, Bosko latches on to the sergeant's trousers; so intense is the wind that the sergeant cannot seem to close the door, and Bosko is so buffeted by the gust that the sergeant's pants follow him to the wall. Once the door is closed, the sergeant angrily confronts his inferior, who, embarrassed, hands the trousers back. But on to business! The sergeant shows Bosko a wanted poster bearing the legend \\"$5000 reward\\" and \\"Dead or Alive.\\" \\"That's your man,\\" growls the sergeant. Out into the cold and wind goes Bosko alone. Three dogs on a sled await their master, two of a proper size, one tiny. Bosko boards his chariot and yells \\"Mush!\\". The dogs thunder across the snowy hills, their legs sometimes extending to accommodate the valleys rather than their bodies simply descending and ascending with the steep slopes. The party crashes into the side of a saloon; the dogs are so tangled as to have become as one, and a disoriented Bosko sits uselessly on the cold ground for a few moments as they collect their bearings. We come with Bosko to the front entrance of the saloon and see again the poster shown to Our Hero by the sergeant. A nervous Bosko spit-shines his badge, readies two revolvers, and enters the bar. Within, Honey dances and scats to the delight of the patrons. Relaxing a moment, Bosko stows his small arms in his pants in order to revel with the customers; upon the table, he dances alongside Honey and scats in such a way that he sounds a bit like a trumpet. He then shows off on the piano, bouncing merrily on a compliant stool as beavers percussively accompany his playing by slapping their tails on the counter. The wanted villain enters, peg-legged, guns blazing! He makes his way to the bar as a terrified Bosko again shines his badge and screws up his courage in anticipation of a fight. Leveling his pistol, he takes aim at the unimpressed ruffian and fires, only to find that, in lieu of bullets, his gun contained only a tethered cork. But the incensed villain takes out his weapon and, just as he is about to fire upon poor Bosko, the clever little fellow spots and spits on a hanging gas lamp, thereby bringing darkness upon the saloon. There is gunfire in the dark, and the light comes back on to reveal the villain still standing, panting, amidst a multitude of smoke, empty seats, and battered tables. The patrons all seem to have left; the villain turns his back and Bosko pops out from under the floorboards mounting a machine gun, which he fires square upon the bad guy's rump. Undaunted, the angry adversary brandishes a saber and chases Bosko to the double doors: these Our Hero swings just so that, himself leaping from the entryway, the fast-pursuing villain's head becomes stuck in the doors. His foe momentarily incapacitated, Bosko captures the sword and sticks it into the villain's rear end. Enraged afresh and newly energized by this latest affront, the villain chases Bosko again, this time to the other end of the bar, where Bosko removes a shotgun from its wall mount: aiming, he fires at the antagonist who, because of the blast, is reduced to a scared, scrawny fellow surrounded by his bandoliers and a ring of his erstwhile fur. Quite finished, he runs off, out of the bar and into the distance. The patrons return to the scene of the action to cheer for their rescuer, who takes a few bows as the iris closes.

It was built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  At the rear of the Hamilton Hotel, the first brickworks in Queensland was started by a Mr. Fisher, who later moved to Albion, and opened up the Albion Pottery (subsequently owned by James Campbell and Sons, Limited). The land on which Woolahra was built was the old brickwords site. Woolahra, a two-storeyed brick house, was probably built in 1888 on land owned by Ellen Elizabeth Wheeler. A widow, she had bought the property in 1887. Its first occupant appears to have been Charles Pritchard who married Mrs Wheeler. In 1896 the land was transferred to Ellen Elizabeth Pritchard. She died in 1932 and the house passed through a number of absentee owners who subdivided the property. The present owners bought the house and its remaining grounds in 1946.  Description  Woolahra is a two-storey brick house which blends Georgian and Renaissance elements in its design. The house is T-shaped, with a one room wide wing across the front forming the crossbar, and a wider wing extending off the rear, forming the stem. Its walls are rendered on the front and southern side, and painted on the northern side and the rear. The hipped corrugated iron roof has a decorative cast-iron comb along the ridges. A double storey verandah featuring decorative cast-iron posts, brackets, balusters and frieze, runs across the front of the house. On the upper floor there are five French doors with leadlight fanlights and on the ground floor the front door has leadlight fan and sidelights with the name Woolahra incorporated. There are bay windows on either side. On the ends of the front wing there are heavily moulded Renaissance style windows which contrast with the simpler Georgian sash windows along the sides and rear of the back wing. The theme of Georgian simplicity is continued inside the house where the lath and plaster walls and ceilings appear undecorated except for substantial joinery.  Heritage listing  Woolahra was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. As a reflection of the confidence of the 1880s boom. As an early example of the type of large houses built on the hills to the northeast of the city. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. As a late illustration of the Georgian style with the addition of renaissance details and ornate verandahs. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.

Athletics is mostly an individual sport, with the exception of relay races and competitions which combine athletes' performances for a team score, such as cross country.

He is also the founder of Spandidos Publications and the editor-in-chief of all eight of its journals.  Education  Spandidos received his bachelor's degree from the University of Thessaloniki in 1971, his PhD from McGill University in 1976, and a DSc from the University of Glasgow in 1989.  Career  From 1976 to 1978, Spandidos worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto, working in the laboratory of Louis Siminovitch. In 1978, Spandidos gave a presentation to a Dana Farber Cancer Institute seminar. In this presentation, Spandidos claimed to have proven that oncogenes were the root cause of all cancers. Robert Weinberg, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was in the audience when Spandidos gave this talk, and later recalled that he had devised what he called \\"exactly the same\\" strategy to identify oncogenes in human tumors not long before Spandidos' talk. Spandidos had published these findings in Cell a month prior to Weinberg having his idea, which, like Spandidos' paper, related to transfectable oncogenes. Spandidos was forced to end his position at the University of Toronto in Siminovitch's laboratory due to accusations of fraud. Two postdocs in Siminovitch lab were unable to reproduce Spandidos' findings, and Spandidos did not present the raw data proving that he was innocent. However, Siminovitch did not initiate an independent investigation and the accusations have never been officially confirmed. From 1978 to 1979, Spandidos was an assistant professor at the Hellenic Anticancer Institute in Athens, Greece. From 1979 to 1989, Spandidos worked at the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, where he studied the Ras oncogene. In 1992, Spandidos established Spandidos Publications, a publisher of scientific journals. It currently publishes eight journals: International Journal of Molecular Medicine, International Journal of Oncology, Molecular Medicine Reports, Oncology Reports, Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine, Oncology Letters, Biomedical Reports, and Molecular and Clinical Oncology.

The slope is in the cricket pitch and runs from the north end of the ground to the south end with a drop of .  History  The land on which Lord's was built was originally near a duck pond on a hill in St. John's Wood. It was leased by Thomas Lord following a request from George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea to find a location where cricket could be played in relative privacy. Lord's was built around the slope and was enclosed by stands. In the 21st century, there were calls for the slope to be levelled as a result of the advent of drop-in pitches. Smaller ridges in the pitch had previously been removed by surveyors.  However, the Marylebone Cricket Club rejected these calls stating that removal of the slope would require rebuilding of Lord's and would mean that the ground would be unable to host Test cricket for five years as the new pitch would need time to mature after the levelling. In 2002, the Lord's outfield was replaced and drainage installed. During this work, several small deviations in the pitch were removed, but the slope remained. During the 2012 Summer Olympics, when Lord's hosted the Archery tournament, there were suggestions that the slope would affect the archers. However, British archer Alison Williamson rejected this, stating that the slope was barely noticeable.  Cricket  The Lord's slope is often used to advantage by bowlers in cricket matches at Lord's. Because of the slope's angles, seam bowlers from the Pavilion End and swing bowlers from the Nursery End gain an advantage as the natural variation of the slope alters the bounce of the ball when bowling. The gradient of the slope is noted to affect right-handed batsmen more than left-handed batsmen as the ball naturally moves towards left-handed batsmen. Despite the advantages the slope gives to bowlers, some batsmen consistently make high scores when playing at Lord's.

In 2007 there were 27,000 baptized. Joseph G√©bara was elected Archeparch on February 20, 2018. Territory and statistics The archeparchy extends its jurisdiction over all the faithful of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church in Jordan. Archeparchial seat is the city of Amman, where is the Cathedral of St. George. The territory is divided into 28 parishes. The archeparchy at the end of 2007 counted 27,000 baptized. History The Archeparchy of Transjordan was erected on May 2, 1932 with the bull Apostolica SedesAAS 25 (1933), p. 25 of Pope Pius XI. The Northern Territory was part of the Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Bosra and Hauran, while the rest of the territory was part of the ancient metropolis of the Archbishop of Petra. In this area in the early twentieth century were established missions both by the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. The foundation of the Archieparchy was the occasion of a comparison between the Melkite Patriarch of Antioch and the Holy See. The patriarch thought that the erection of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction depended on him, as the new home was an integral part of his patriarchate. Rome instead started from the principle that most of the territory of the new eparchy depended on the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, of which the patriarch of Antioch was only administrator, and that the conditions of this administration had never been determined or clarified. In the above the bubble archeparchy assumed the name of Transjordan, terminology foreign to the history and tradition not only of the Melkite Church, but of all the Christian East. Moreover, the same bubble adds that \\"Transjordaniam regionem in veram ac propriam archidioecesim erigimus et constituimus,\\" without specifying further if with Archidioecesis meant a home or an autocephalous metropolis of distinct groups in the Oriental Canon Law. Patriarch Cyril IX Moghabghab consecrated in Cairo June 5, 1932 the first archeparch Paul Salman, entrusting him with the title of Metropolitan of Petra, Philadelphia and Transjordan. These securities to him two ancient sites, Petra and Philadelphia of Palestine of Arabia: the first is a metropolitan see and the second a simple suffragan dioceses; the first part of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, the second that of Antioch. According to Korolevsky (Dict. Hist. Et Geogr. Eccl.), these inaccuracies are signs of 'complete absence of knowledge on the subject of ecclesiastical geography ancient and traditional.\\"vol.

Subjects that were studied were machine shops practice, mechanical drawing, mathematics, science, English and civics. In 1927 staff and students were relocated to a buildingFall 2014 Course Catalog in New Brunswick Avenue in Perth Amboy, It was a 3-story building with six shops; it had a small gym and a parking lot that could only accommodate staff. Shops were intended to help students get jobs and enter the workforce after graduation. In the earlier years most classes were segregated and were gender specific. Eventually shops became integrated. In the last year of the second building the shops were Machine Technology, Auto Mechanics, Computer Assisted Business, Computer Assisted Drafting and Design, HVAC, Carpentry, Electrical Trade and a day would have 8 periods.https://www2.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/2012/applications/nj2-middlesex- county-vocational-school-perth-amboy.pdf The sports involved Soccer, Basketball and Softball, respectively each had Varsity and Junior Varsity and girls didn't participate in sports. The school at one point held over 400 students and eventually needed to be expanded in order to accommodate more. In Summer/Fall 2002 construction of the new building started and it opened in spring of 2004. The new school allowed girls' programs for basketball, softball and co-ed soccer. The new building allowed expanded programs in the school and Middlesex County College is also located in the facility. New campus The new Middlesex County Vocational and Technical High School, on High Street, Perth Amboy, is a building. Its cost was about $28 million, and it will replace the 76-year-old building on New Brunswick Avenue. It was decided that the school should stay located there. As projected, the school houses up to 250 high school students. In the evenings there's an average of about 100 adults students and 250 part-time college students in the building. The school offers special classes or 'shops' to students with an interest in learning a new skill. Some of the shops consist of carpentry, electrical trades, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC). This area is considered the School of Construction and Technology. Each area is like a major at a college. The second area is the School of Computer and Business technology. This area of study in the school includes computer applications, computer assisted drafting and computer systems technology. Students obtain the benefit to learn how to work in a busy office environment in preparation to obtain their certification in their respected field. The last area is the School of Professional Services. The two remaining shops to conclude this series are auto mechanics technology and culinary arts. Here the students will learn the maintenance and basic repair of vehicles and grow accustomed to the work space of a busy restaurant environment. To expand on the uses of the building aside from providing shops, there is the inclusion of a wellness center, media center, athletic fields and a gymnasium. The building will also include computer rooms in between classrooms to provide students with easy access to the internet in case of class activities or research. The remaining 112,000 square feet of the building, will be utilized for the Middlesex County College. Having both the high school and college share the same building enables students to see life after graduation. It allows easy access to the college and gives them a firsthand experience as to how they should go about as to managing their college necessities.

Oh her fifth voyage, which occurred early in the French Revolutionary Wars, the French captured her during the Sunda Strait campaign of 1794. Career Voyage #1 (1780-1782) Captain Robert Morgan left Portsmouth on 3 June 1780, bound for China and Benkulen. Pigot reached Whampoa on 2 February 1781. For her return voyage she crossed the Second Bar, about 20 miles before Whampoa, on 8 April, and was at Macao on 23 April. She reached Benkulen, where the EIC had a factory, on 1 August and Padang on 19 August, and returned to Benkulen on 25 September. She then reached St Helena on 17 December, and Plymouth on 10 March 1782. She arrived at the Downs on 31 March. Voyage #2 (1783-85) Morgan left Portsmouth on 11 March 1783, bound for Madras and Bengal. Pigot reached S√£o Tiago on 31 March and Johanna on 17 July. On 24 August caught fire off Ceylon and was destroyed. Duke of Kingston was in company with Pigot, , and , all of which were safe. Some 65 passengers, crew, troops, and their dependents died. {[Lloyd's List] ‚Ññ1532.] Pigot reached Madras on 26 August. She arrived at Kedgeree on 10 October. Homeward bound, she passed Saugor on 15 February 1784 and reached Vizagapatam on 14 March. She stopped in again at Madras on 3 April, went to Coringa on 5 June, returned to Madras on 2 October, reached Coringa again on 25 November, was at Masulipatam on 5 January 1785, and was again at Madras on 10 January. On 2 May she was at the Kromme River, where Morgan took the latitude and longitude as , with the longitude being 7¬∞ 38' east of Cape Town.The Monthly Review, Or, Literary Journal, Vol. 74, p.516. The correct figures for the river's mouth are , indicating the ongoing difficulty of calculating longitude. Pigot reached False Bay on 8 June and St Helena on 19 July. She arrived at the Downs on 9 October. Voyage #3 (1786-87) George Ballantyne (or Ballantine), was Pigots captain for this and the next two voyages. He left the Downs on 26 March 1786, bound for China. Pigot reached Whampoa on 11 September. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 5 January 1787, reached North Island - the northmost of three islands in the bay that formed the principle anchorage of Enggano Island - on 2 March, and St Helena on 2 June. She arrived back at the Downs on 12 August. Voyage #4 (1789-1790) Ballantyne left the Downs on 6 March 1789, bound for Madras and Bengal. Pigot reached Madras on 28 June and arrived at Diamond Harbour on 8 July. Homeward bound, she passed Saugor on 23 December, reached Madras on 2 February 1790, and St Helena on 29 August. She arrived back at the Downs on 29 June. Voyage #5 (1793 and loss) Ballantyne left Portsmouth on 22 May 1793, bound for Bengal and Benkulen. War with France had broken out almost four months earlier, so as became the common practice for EIC vessels, he received a letter of marque on 17 April. This authorized him to engage in offensive action against the French, not just defensive. Pigot was part of a convoy that included the East Indiamen Prince William, Lord Thurlow, William Pitt, , , Earl of Oxford, , Fort William, London, , Marquis of Landsdown, , , and Earl of Abergavenny, amongst numerous other vessels, merchant and military, most of the non-Indiamen travelling to the Mediterranean.Gentleman's magazine (May 1793), Vol 63, part. 1, p. 474. On 24 June, Pigot captured the French brig La France, which was sailing from \\"the Mauritius\\" to France.Lloyd's List, no. 2589, - accessed 31 December 2014. The account in the London Gazette refers to the brig as Le Franc. From the number of vessels named in separate accounts as sharing in the prize money, it is clear that the fleet shared the capture. Ceres took possession. Pigot reached Diamond Harbour on 14 September. Capture The withdrawal of the Royal Navy squadron from Indian waters had left the EIC's trade vulnerable to privateers from √éle de France (Mauritius). The EIC therefore decided to equip a squadron of its merchantmen as cruisers to protect its trade. The squadron consisted of the East Indiamen William Pitt, Houghton, , and the Bombay Marine (EIC) 14-gun brig Nautilus, all under the overall command of Commodore Charles Mitchell of William Pitt. Contemporary accounts of the composition of squadron vary widely. One account lists the vessels as , Pigot, Houghton, Nonsuch, and the cruiser Viper. It states their task would be to cruise the Malacca and Sunda Straits, and the Bay of Bengal, when not actually convoying the trade.Houghton, Roger - A Peoples' History 1793 ‚Äì 1844 from the newspapers: Prize-taking, - accessed 29 December 2014. Lloyd's List lists the squadron as consisting of William Pitt, Oxford, Houghton, Nonsuch, Britannia, and the \\"Nancy Grab\\".A grab was a two- or three-masted vessel used on the Malabar Coast. They were armed and believed to be cruising the Straits. Pigot was to accompany them to Benkulen.Lloyd's List, no. 2600, - accessed 31 December 2014. Pigot passed Saugor on 27 November, and reached Penang on 21 December. She left Penang three days later with a large supply of military stores for Bencoolen. She arrived at Benkulen on 12 January 1794. In the meantime, the EIC squadron under Commodore Charles Mitchell passed Singapore on 2 January 1794, sailing eastwards in search of French raiders. As the British squadron travelled along the northern coast of Sumatra, two French privateers attacked Bencoolen on the southern coast. The privateers were the 30-gun Vengeur and the 26-gun R√©solu. On 17 January they approached the mouth of Rat Island Basin close to Bencoolen where Pigot lay at anchor, completely unprepared for action.Brenton, p. 219. At 08:15 Vengeur opened fire at , maintaining the battle for an hour and 45 minutes before hauling off so that R√©solu could continue the combat. Ballantyne defended his vessel intelligently, positioning Pigot so that the French could only approach one at a time through the narrow mouth of the bay. This allowed him to drive off each ship in turn, the privateers falling back together at 10:20 with damaged rigging. Pigot too had suffered, with one man mortally wounded and sufficient damage to the rigging to require several weeks of repairs. After immediate repairs had been completed, next day Corosin abandoned Bencoolen and retreated to the Sunda Strait in search of weaker targets.Clowes, Vol. 4, p. 483. The governor at Bencoolen sent over reinforcements to Pigot in the form of a lieutenant, 40 sepoys, and two 18-pounder guns. They arrived too late to assist, and Ballantayne sent them to Rat Island to establish a battery as he could not use the guns.Biden (1823), pp.204-208. Early on 22 January, Mitchell's squadron stopped a merchant ship for inspection and as the ship was searched two new sails appeared to the southwest near Shown Rock in the Zuften Islands. Suspicious of the identity of the new arrivals, Mitchell sent Britannia and Nonsuch in pursuit and the ships turned away. As the East Indiamen closed with the fleeing ships, they were identified as Vengeur and R√©solu. The British vessels soon outran the French and the French opened fire to which the larger British vessels responded. Captain Thomas Cheap of Britannia engaged Vengeur while Captain John Canning of Nonsuch attacked R√©solu at 10:45 and were soon supported by William Pitt and Houghton. The overwhelming numbers and size of the British squadron soon convinced Corosin and Jallineaux that further resistance was pointless and 45 minutes after the first shots were fired both surrendered.James, p. 197. On 25 January in the Sunda strait, Mitchell engaged a French naval squadron under the overall command of Captain Jean-Marie Renaud. The squadron had sailed from the √éle de France and consisted of the frigates Prudente and Cyb√®le, the brig Vulcain, and the captured , now renamed Duguay-Trouin. The combat was inconclusive and both sides withdrew, Mitchell to Batavia. The French squadron under Renaud withdrew into the Indian Ocean via Bencoolen, which they reached on 6 February. Pigot was still there, undergoing repairs in the Rat Island basin. The attack did not take place until the next day. Although Ballantyne resisted for half-an-hour, he was so outnumbered and outgunned that at 4pm he was forced to strike. As the French maneuvered Pigot out of the bay, Renaud demanded that the small Fort Marlborough nearby surrender.James (2002/1827), p.199. Actually, Renaud demanded 300,000 dollars as a ransom in lieu of surrender. Captain Thomas Brown, commander of the garrison of 20 Europeans and 300 sepoys, declined. He, his two officers, and the garrison showed such energy in preparing the defenses, heating shot, etc., that Renaud withdrew.History... (1877), Vol. 1, p. 246. The French then returned to √éle de France. Lloyd's List reported, \\"The Pigot (Ballantine), of London; the Sacramento, a Portuguese Ship; and the Ceres, ---- -----, the latter from Manilla to Bengal, have been taken by the French and carried into the Mauritius.\\"Lloyd's List, no. 2629, - accessed 31 December 2014.

Post-script On 1 June a snow from Mauritius arrived at the Danish exclave of Tranquebar. She brought the news that Pigot had arrived at Mauritius on 14 March. Ballantayne, his first officer, two midshipmen, and four crew were aboard her. Her captors had divided up the rest of the crew over the vessels of their squadron. The French permitted Ballantyne to return to England on his own parole. Ballantyne left in an American ship for New York.The Times (17 July 1794), p.2. The rest of the officers and crew, who reported that the French had treated them well, were waiting for a cartel that would take them to Madras. At the end of March, the Danish ship Minerva, Coulthard, master, was to take 50 British prisoners at the end of March. The Times reported that \\"the remainder of the crew of the Pigot with some Dutchmen taken in a packet from Batavia were in a cartel Ship bound to Madras but which was prevented from sailing by the people on shore who suspecting the Captain was an Aristocrat unhung her rudder and carried him on shore for trial.\\" As it was, the prisoners were freed at Bombay in August.

It was designed by Eaton & Bates and built from 1905 to 1906. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Side view of the distinctive, pavilion verandahs of Cremorne, circa 1935 Cremorne is a substantial, single-storeyed, high-set timber residence erected for Brisbane publican James Denis O'Connor. It was designed by the firm of Eaton & Bates, Sydney-trained architects who built up a substantial Queensland practice from -. JD O'Connor, born in Ireland , had emigrated to South Australia in 1878, and was in business in Adelaide before moving north to Queensland, reputedly for health reasons, in 1889. His brother, Denis O'Connor, was already a well-known Brisbane publican, connected from at least 1884 with a number of Brisbane hotels, including the Globe Hotel, Dunmore Arms Hotel, O'Connor's Family Hotel (at Stones Corner), Oriental House (later the Wickham) from 1890, and later with the Prince Consort Hotel in Fortitude Valley. JD O'Connor held the licence to the Stanley Hotel at the corner of Stanley Street and Boggo Road, Woolloongabba, 1890-96. In Brisbane in 1895, JD O'Connor married Catherine Julia Graham, whose father, John Graham, was one of the earliest land holders at Moreton Bay, having purchased land at South Brisbane in 1842. Johnny Graham was a well-known Brisbane identity and property owner, and a keen sportsman. For 30 years, from 1866 to 1896, he held the licences to several South Brisbane hotels. He established Graham's Family Hotel in Stanley Street, South Brisbane in 1888, and held the licence until 1896, when it was transferred to his son-in-law, who changed the name to O'Connor's Hotel. JD O'Connor is understood to have sold O'Connor's Hotel , and retired from the hotel business altogether . In 1904, JD O'Connor obtained title to nearly of hillside land at Hamilton, formerly part of the Eldernell Estate and first subdivided in 1890. Here he erected a very fine timber residence which he named Cremorne. Although the JD O'Connor's had only one child, a daughter born in 1896, they erected a large house designed for entertaining, with generously proportioned rooms, and wide verandahs and verandah pavilions which took advantage of the views of the Brisbane river, southern suburbs and city. It was designed by one of the most fashionable architectural firms of the day, Messrs Eaton & Bates of Brisbane, Rockhampton and Townsville. Sydney-trained architects George T Eaton and Albert E Bates had formed a partnership in Rockhampton and developed a successful Central Queensland practice in the late 19th century, with branch offices established at Mount Morgan and Longreach by 1898, Clermont in 1900, Gladstone in 1901, Maryborough in 1902, and Townsville by 1902. Arthur B Polin of Sydney joined the partnership in Townsville , as Eaton, Bates & Polin. After 1902 their head office was moved to Brisbane, with branches retained at Rockhampton and Townsville. A branch operated briefly at Toowoomba in the early 1900s. They undertook a wide variety of architectural work, from hotels and commercial buildings to residences, hospitals and masonic halls, and received a number of commissions from the Catholic Church - churches, schools, convents and presbyteries. One of their most glamorous commissions was for the new Queen's Hotel (1901‚Äì04) (Telecasters North Queensland Ltd Building) at Townsville. Cremorne (1905‚Äì06) is one of their larger residential designs. Their style was eclectic, drawing upon both eastern and western classical traditions, with a particular emphasis on verandahs and pavilions - both as a decorative device and as appropriate to the warm Queensland climate. Eaton & Bates called tenders for a large villa residence on the Eldernell Estate, Hamilton, in June 1905, and this is thought to refer to Cremorne. The JD O'Connors were resident at Mullens Street, Hamilton, by 1907. Three generations of the O'Connor family resided on the property for nearly 90 years, and retained ownership until the late 1990s. JD O'Connor had transferred title to his wife in 1916, prior to his death (at Cremorne) in 1919. Following Mrs O'Connor's death in 1952, Cremorne passed to their daughter, Lynette Mulcahy, who had married Thomas Edward Mulcahy in 1921. The Mulcahys had two children, a son and daughter, and Cremorne subsequently passed to their daughter, who subdivided the land, selling the house on a reduced site in 1998. Both the house site and the vacant block in front are included in the heritage listing boundary.  Description  Southeast rotunda, 2015 Cremorne is a large, imposing, single-storeyed timber residence, situated halfway up the steep slope of Eldernell/Hamilton Hill in Brisbane, with expansive views of the Brisbane River and the city's southeastern suburbs. It has extensive grounds sloping down the hill to Kingsford Smith Drive, ending in a steep stone cutting, and is a prominent landmark from the southern suburbs. The higher ground has terraced lawns, with a long, central flight of concrete steps leading to the lower terrace. A bituminoid driveway, accessed from Mullens Street through brick entrance pillars and a timber trellis, sweeps in front of the house and up around the eastern side of the property to a carport at the rear. This driveway is lined by an avenue of distinctive, mature Queen Palms Arecastrum romanzoffianum. Further down the slope the grounds comprise mostly indigenous vegetation. The house is almost L-shaped in plan, and has a corrugated iron roof which is a complex of hips, gables, ridges and pavilions, with decorative gablets and finials, and three brick chimneys. There are verandahs, with separate roofs, on all four sides. Several of these have been enclosed. The open verandahs all have simple timber balustrading and timber frieze, and ceilings of narrow tongue and groove timber. Most of the walls are single-skin tongue and groove timber, but where exposed to the weather, are clad externally with chamferboards. Due to excavation and the natural falling away of the ground toward the south, the house is high-set at the front, which faces south toward the river, but low- set at the rear, where there is a small, level backyard excavated from the hillside. The house mostly sits on timber stumps with concrete footings, but the perimeter stumps have been replaced by brick piers with arched timber battening between. A centrally positioned divided brick stair, with a gabled portico above, gives access to the front verandah and front entrance. The front elevation is dominated by a deep, open verandah with large rotundas or pavilions at the southwest and southeast corners, which take advantage of the views and river breezes. This verandah has simple timber valances, posts and balusters, and the rotundas have ogee-shaped cupolas above a frieze of pink and green glass panels. At the southwest corner of the house a large, faceted bay window projects onto the verandah from the main bedroom; this is mirrored at the southeast corner by another faceted bay from the drawing room. Both bays have very fine Art Nouveau leadlights, and there are similar leadlights around the front entrance door. The front exterior wall has later fibrous cement sheeting and timber battening, creating a vaguely Tudoresque appearance. On the western side of the house, the verandah outside the main and second bedrooms is enclosed with casement windows and fibrous cement sheeting behind the timber balustrade, and is separated from the southwest rotunda by large folding timber doors. The narrow, western verandah passageway outside the rear bedrooms and bathroom is only partly enclosed, with a timber frieze and timber lattice infill above the timber balustrade. Part of the eastern verandah, adjacent to the drawing room, is enclosed as a sunroom, with a single door opening onto the southeast corner rotunda. The rear verandah still functions as a passage, but is enclosed with chamferboards and sliding aluminium-framed windows. Internally, the house retains the original configuration of rooms, with the private rooms on the western side separated by an entrance vestibule and north-south central hallway from the public rooms on the eastern side, and a service wing at the rear. The private rooms comprise a master bedroom and second bedroom opening off the central hall, and a side passage leading west from the central hallway to the dressing room, bathroom, and another bedroom. A small bedroom at the northwest corner of the house is accessed from the now enclosed rear verandah. There is another room, possibly a former bedroom, which also opens off the back verandah, but has been modified substantially. Opening off the front vestibule to the east is the drawing room, which has a southeast bay with leadlight windows and French doors opening onto the front verandah. The dining room opens off the central hallway and has an eastern bay with leadlights and a large, step-out window opening onto the eastern verandah. Drawing and dining rooms are separated by a side passage which leads east off the central hallway to what is now the sunroom (formerly part of the eastern verandah). The door opening from this hallway to the sunroom is an external door, with leadlight surrounds. The service wing behind the dining room comprises servery, crockery room, kitchen (with a fitout) and two servant's bedrooms, one of which has early linoleum flooring. A later bathroom and laundry are located on the enclosed verandah of the service wing. The interior has early joinery throughout - including a decorative, arched timber divider between the entrance vestibule and central hallway, and timber arches to the side passageways - all of which has been painted. The drawing and dining rooms have fireplaces with early marbled timber fireplace surrounds, fireplace and hearth tiles, and metal grates and fenders. Most of the timber partition walls are clad with later fibrous cement sheeting with wallpaper and a later timber dado strip. Most of the rooms have later plaster ceilings, but the entrance vestibule and drawing room have early, decorative pressed metal ceilings. Floors throughout are of narrow hardwood.  Heritage listing  Cremorne was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Cremorne, a large, substantially intact timber residence constructed in 1905-06, is important in illustrating the continued development of Hamilton in the late 19th/early 20th centuries, as one of Brisbane's most prestigious suburbs. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The house is an outstanding example of Queensland federation-period domestic architecture, which, with its generous verandahs, distinctive rotundas, and attention to ventilation in the design, materials and details, addresses both aspect and climate in a creative and aesthetic manner. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Situated on a prominent riverside site, Cremorne and its grounds are significant for their landmark and aesthetic qualities. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The house is important as the only identified Brisbane example of the domestic work of architects Eaton & Bates, who made a significant contribution to Queensland architecture in the late 1890s and early 1900s.

He cofounded the Knoxville Register, which during its early years was the city's only newspaper, and operated a printing firm that published a number of early important books on Tennessee history and law. He also served one term in the Tennessee Senate (1847-1849), and briefly served as Mayor of Knoxville in 1835. He was a trustee, organizer, or financial supporter of numerous schools and civic organizations. A Southern Unionist, Heiskell was a delegate to the pro-Union East Tennessee Convention on the eve of the Civil War. After the war, he opposed the radical policies of Governor William G. Brownlow. Early life and career Heiskell was born in Hagerstown, Maryland, the son of Frederic Heiskell, a farmer, and Catherine (Steidinger) Heiskell. While still young, his family moved to Shenandoah County, Virginia, where he attended subscription schools. He began working in the printing shop of his brother, John, in Winchester, Virginia, in 1810. In 1814, he moved to Knoxville, where he worked as a printer for the Knoxville Gazette, a newspaper that had been founded in the early 1790s by George Roulstone, but was then being published by Roulstone's old business partner, George Wilson.Mary Rothrock, The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (East Tennessee Historical Society, 1972), pp. 422-424. Heiskell married Eliza Brown, a sister of Knoxville Latin teacher Hugh Brown, on July 17, 1816, in Jonesborough, Tennessee. On August 3 of that year, he and Hugh Brown launched the Knoxville Register. Heiskell was responsible for the paper's political commentary, while Brown focused on its literary content.\\"The Late Maj. F.S. Heiskell,\\" Knoxville Chronicle, 5 December 1882, p. 3. After Brown retired in 1829, Heiskell continued alone until 1837, when he sold the paper to W.B.A. Ramsey and Robert Craighead. The Register supported Senator John Williams in his feud with Andrew Jackson in 1823.Stanley J. Folmsbee, Sectionalism and Internal Improvements in Tennessee, 1796-1845 (East Tennessee Historical Society, 1939), p. 57n. While it endorsed Jackson in the 1824 and 1828 presidential races, it supported fellow Knoxvillian Hugh Lawson White of the burgeoning anti-Jackson Whig Party in the 1836 race. Along with the Register, the printing shop of Heiskell and Brown published numerous books, pamphlets, and other works. These included Judge John Haywood's Civil and Political History of Tennessee (1823), one of the first comprehensive histories of the state, Judge Edward Scott's Laws of the State of Tennessee (1821), sermons by religious figures such as Isaac L. Anderson and John Doak, and the first major work of William \\"Parson\\" Brownlow, Helps to the Study of Presbyterianism (1834). Heiskell and Brown also published the Western Monitor and Religious Observer, a periodical which advocated emancipation, from 1818 to 1820.William MacArthur, Jr., Knoxville: Crossroads of the New South (Tulsa: Continental Heritage Press, 1982), pp. 30-31. Heiskell used the columns of the Register to support education and civic advancement in Knoxville. The paper led the drive to reopen East Tennessee College (the forerunner of the University of Tennessee) in 1820, and advocated the establishment of the Knoxville Female Academy in 1827. Heiskell helped finance this latter institution, which later became the East Tennessee Female Institute, and served both as a professor and as one of its trustees from its founding in 1827 until his death in 1882. Heiskell was a cofounder of the Knoxville Library Company (a subscription- based library), and served as the first president of the Knoxville Typographical Society. Heiskell was first elected to Knoxville's Board of Aldermen in 1824, and served in this capacity through 1831. He returned to the Board in 1835, and briefly served as mayor that year.Lucile Deaderick, Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), pp. 635-636. In 1847, he was elected to the Tennessee Senate seat for Knox County. His committee assignments included Education and Common Schools, Internal Improvement, Claims, and Banks. He was also appointed by Speaker Josiah M. Anderson to a three-man \\"engrossment\\" committee, which was tasked with finalizing bills before they were sent to the House.Senate Journal for the First Session of the Twenty-Seventh General Assembly of the State of Tennessee (Bang and Company, 1848), pp. 43, 55, 150. During the 1850s, Heiskell focused on business and farming interests. He was appointed to the Board of Directors for the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad in 1852,\\"State Directors,\\" Athens (TN) Post, 23 January 1852, p. 2. and was elected president of the Knox County Agricultural Society in 1856.\\"Agricultural,\\" Nashville Union and American, 25 March 1856, p. 2. He remained politically active, however, chairing an American Party (\\"Know Nothing\\") convention in Knoxville in October 1855.\\"Our Mass Meeting,\\" Nashville True Whig, 2 October 1855, p. 2. Civil War As the secession crisis heated up following the election of Abraham Lincoln in November 1860, Heiskell wrote a letter to Constitutional Union candidate John Bell suggesting he call a convention of Southern states to discuss the crisis. Heiskell believed such a convention would isolate fanatical secessionists and allow moderates a greater voice, and give Southern states an opportunity to explain their grievances to the Northern states.Robert McKenzie, Lincolnites and Rebels: A Divided Town in the American Civil War (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 56. While he was supported in this effort by fellow Knoxville Unionist John Baxter, other Knoxville Unionists, including Oliver Perry Temple and Samuel R. Rodgers, were convinced that secessionists would dominate such a convention, and advised against it.Oliver Perry Temple, East Tennessee and the Civil War (R. Clarke and Company, 1899), pp. 150-151. Heiskell campaigned against secession throughout the first half of 1861.Temple, East Tennessee and the Civil War, p. 182. In May 1861, he attended the pro-Union East Tennessee Convention as a member of the Knox County delegation. While he abandoned open resistance to the Confederacy after the Confederate Army occupied the region in August 1861, he was nevertheless arrested in December for refusing to take the Confederate oath of allegiance, and charged with \\"inciting rebellion.\\"McKenzie, Lincolnites and Rebels, p. 103. He reportedly told his son, \\"I will rot in jail before I take that oath.\\"\\"Major Frederick S. Heiskell,\\" Memphis Public Ledger, 2 December 1882, p. 2. He was released after ten days on the orders of General Felix K. Zollicoffer, the commander of Confederate forces in the region, who had once worked in Heiskell's printing office. In February 1862, Heiskell exchanged \\"angry words\\" with Colonel Danville Leadbetter when he was denied leave to visit Unionist leader William \\"Parson\\" Brownlow, who had been jailed in Knoxville.William G. Brownlow, Sketches of the Rise, Progress, and Decline of Secession (De Capo Press, 1968; originally published in 1862), p. 355. Like many East Tennessee families, the Heiskells were divided during the Civil War. Frederick and his brother, William Heiskell, were ardent Unionists. Frederick's sons, Joseph Brown Heiskell and Carrick White Heiskell, along with three sons-in-law, supported the Confederacy. Joseph served in the Confederate Congress, and Carrick rose to the rank of colonel in the Confederate army. Carrick was married to Eliza Netherland, a daughter of prominent Unionist John Netherland.William S. Speer, \\"Hon. John Netherland,\\" Sketches of Prominent Tennesseans (Genealogical Publishing Company, 2010), p. 62. Postwar politics Toward the end of the war, Heiskell's decades-old friendship with Brownlow began to sour. When the East Tennessee Convention reconvened in Knoxville in April 1864, Heiskell supported the convention's \\"conservative\\" faction, which opposed the Emancipation Proclamation and endorsed George B. McClellan for president. Brownlow, who had become a celebrity in the North, led the faction that supported the Proclamation and endorsed Lincoln for president. Heiskell accused Brownlow of selling \\"his books and his soul\\" to northern abolitionists, and stated his supporters would do whatever \\"dirty work their dirty master commanded them.\\"McKenzie, Lincolnites and Rebels, pp. 190-192. After Joseph Brown Heiskell was captured by Union soldiers in August 1864, Brownlow's newspaper, the Whig, demanded he face the \\"most rigorous\\" military penalties.\\"The Case of Old Fred. Heiskell,\\" Knoxville Whig, 13 June 1866, p. 2. In August 1865, Heiskell ran for the second district's open seat in Congress. He expressed support for President Andrew Johnson, and vowed to seek compensation for East Tennessee Unionists whose property had been taken or destroyed by the Union Army.Frederick S. Heiskell, \\"To the Voters of the Second Congressional District,\\" Knoxville Whig and Rebel Ventilator, 26 July 1865, p. 1. He also opposed black suffrage, though he had accepted emancipation as an outcome of the war. He defended his endorsement of McClellan in 1864, stating that while he had \\"full faith and confidence in Mr. Lincoln's patriotism,\\" he had preferred McClellan for his military experience.Frederick S. Heiskell, \\"To the Voters of the Second Congressional District of the State of Tennessee,\\" Knoxville Whig and Rebel Ventilator, 6 September 1865, p. 1. The Whig, which had endorsed Horace Maynard for the seat, suggested that Heiskell was supported by \\"all the rebels and copperheads of the second district.\\"\\"The Congressional Race,\\" Knoxville Whig and Rebel Ventilator, 26 July 1865, p. 2. On election day, Heiskell garnered just 217 of the 12,785 votes cast in the election, placing fifth and far behind the winner, Maynard.\\"Vote of the Knoxville District,\\" Knoxville Whig and Rebel Ventilator, 13 September 1865, p. 2. Heiskell blamed the lopsided loss on voter intimidation, and accused Brownlow of meddling in the election. The feud between Brownlow and Heiskell flared up again in April 1866, when the Whig accused Heiskell of calling Brownlow a \\"damned liar\\" at a rally in Knoxville. In a scathing editorial published in the Knoxville Commercial, Heiskell denied cursing, but stood by his accusation that Brownlow was a liar. He ripped Brownlow as a \\"parody of a Governor,\\" the \\"incarnation of all villification,\\" and the \\"embodiment of filthy abuse.\\" He stated that Brownlow's typical editorials were nothing more than the \\"low, coarse, vulgar personal abuse of better men than himself.\\" The Whig dismissed Heiskell's attack as \\"a bungling mass of vulgar epithets,\\" and stated that Heiskell was merely angry over the financial losses he had suffered due to the emancipation of his slaves.John Bell Brownlow, \\"Frederick S. Heiskell,\\" Knoxville Whig, 2 May 1866, p. 2. In May 1866, Heiskell published another editorial in which he accused Brownlow of exaggerating his \\"sufferings\\" at the hands of Confederate authorities in order to exploit northern sympathy and sell books.\\"The Terrible 'Sufferings' of the Loyal,\\" Fayetteville Observer, 31 May 1866, p. 2. The Whig responded with an article mocking Heiskell as an \\"old Whisky-rotted, broken-down political hack\\" who had only pretended to be a Unionist to support his family's Confederate interests. It also rehashed accusations that Joseph Brown Heiskell had committed multiple atrocities during the war. Heiskell helped organize the state's delegation to the National Union Convention in Philadelphia in August 1866.\\"Adjourned Meeting of Conservatives,\\" Clarksville Weekly Chronicle, 13 July 1866, p. 1. He remained only marginally active in politics in later years. Later life and family Heiskell and his first wife Eliza had ten children, seven of whom lived into adulthood: Joseph Brown, Hugh Brown, Ann, Margaret, Susan, Carrick White, and Ferdinand. In 1853, two years after his first wife died, he married a widow, Alice Armstrong Fulkerson. They had two daughters, Blanche and Alice. Joseph and Carrick moved to Memphis after the Civil War; Joseph served as state attorney general in the 1870s, and Carrick served as a circuit court judge. Hugh Brown Heiskell was among the \\"49ers\\" who moved to California during the Gold Rush in the late 1840s.Hugh Brown Heiskell, Edward M. Steel (ed.), A Forty-niner from Tennessee: The Diary of Hugh Brown Heiskell (University of Tennessee Press, 1998), p. xiii. Frederick's grandson, John Netherland Heiskell, briefly served as a U.S. senator from Arkansas in 1913. A nephew, Samuel Gordon Heiskell (1858-1923), served several terms as Mayor of Knoxville between 1896 and 1915. After Heiskell's second wife, Alice, died in 1874, he moved to a house in downtown Knoxville. He spent his final years living with his daughter in Rogersville,\\"Old Time Papers,\\" Knoxville Chronicle, 23 February 1882, p. 4. where he died in 1882.

Vardry McBee (June 19, 1775 - January 23, 1864) was a saddlemaker, merchant, farmer, entrepreneur and philanthropist who has frequently been called the father of Greenville, South Carolina. Youth McBee, the youngest of ten children, was born to an impecunious Revolutionary War officer in the Spartanburg District of South Carolina and reared in Thicketty. After working on his parents farm as a teenager, in 1794, he was apprenticed to his brother-in-law, a saddler and postmaster in Lincolnton, North Carolina.Smith, 44-56; DeBow's, 314. Briefly a clerk at a grocery in Charleston, South Carolina, and a pioneer farmer with his parents in Logan County, Kentucky, McBee returned to Lincolnton as a saddler and merchant, where he prospered and, in 1804, married Jane Alexander, the daughter of a prominent local family.DeBow's, 314; Smith, 79-83. They had nine children, seven of whom survived to maturity.Smith, 336-37, 145. McBee's first child survived only two months, but his son Silas died at seventeen, a lost that prostrated McBee because they had been close. McBee may also have had several children by a slave mistress. The black architect William Wilson Cooke was once a slave of McBee's and may also have been his grandson.Derek Spurlock Wilson, ed., African American Architects, 1865-1945 (New York: Routledge, 2004), 148. In 1806, McBee was partially, but permanently, lamed when he was thrown from a horse and broke his leg.Smith, 92. Farmer and entrepreneur After buying up worn-out land abandoned by westward immigrants, McBee practiced new methods of restoring the fertility of the soil, such as drainage, the use of manures, crop rotation, and seed selection.Smith, 87. In 1815 he purchased from Lemuel J. Alston more than 11,000 of acres of land in South Carolina, including the heart of what is today Greenville. He established a number of small industrial works on the Reedy River, including a sawmill, ironworks, brick yard, and stone quarry.Smith, 110. McBee also engaged in selling leather goods, locating his tannery on the outskirts of the village.Judy Bainbridge, \\"City founder Vardry McBee made saddles,\\" Greenville News, October 22, 2015, D1. In 1831 the Greenville District had three tanneries and in 1850, seven, of which McBee's was the largest, employing five men. In 1829, he built a stone mill in Greenville and a flour mill and paper mill seven miles down stream in modern Conestee.Helsley, 14-15; Belcher, 21. McBee used the same mill to operate cotton and woolen factories, ordering textile machinery from the New Jersey firm of Rogers, Ketchum & Grosvenor. McBee's cotton and woolen products were apparently competitive with those produced by the Northern textile industry. DeBow's Review reported that they sold in New York for \\"a handsome profit.\\"Smith, 11-12; Debow's, 316. McBee operated general stores in Greenville and Conestee, effectively company stores where his employees could make purchases on credit. He also provided housing for his workers. By 1838, his factory operated around the clock with shift changes at midnight.Belcher, 21; Smith, 170-71. McBee also owned two gold mines in Greenville County and extracted enough gold to have bars transported to the mint in Philadelphia.Smith, 118-19. In 1830, when the population of Greenville was about 600, McBee owned two grist mills, a sawmill, an iron works, a saddlery, tan yards, and a brick yard.Smith, 132. Finally, in 1836 McBee and his family moved permanently to Greenville.Smith, 150. Railroad promoter In the 1830s, McBee became a promoter of railroads, and he briefly served as president of the Louisville, Cincinnati and Charleston Railroad in 1839.Smith, 186-88. In 1852, when the Greenville and Columbia Railroad was about to fail, McBee saved it by subscribing $50,000, a contribution that Debow's called \\"the largest individual subscription ever made to a Rail-road in the United States.\\"DeBow's, 317. Unionist A unionist, though a slave owner, McBee opposed South Carolina's flirtation with secession in 1853. In 1860, after South Carolina voted for secession, McBee told what amounted to a public celebration in Greenville that he was sorry the Union could not continue and that South Carolina must avoid war, that the North was very strong.Smith, 295-96. One of McBee's slaves was James R. Rosemond, later a Methodist Episcopal preacher and organizer. In 1862, McBee sold his Reedy River Factory, a paper mill, and 321 acres, and these were placed at the disposal of the Confederacy. Greenville was also chosen as the site of the State Military Works because McBee gave South Carolina twenty acres of land to build on. McBee died two years later at the age of 89.Smith, 309; Belcher, 21. Personality Statue of Vardry McBee by T. J. Dixon, Greenville, South Carolina. McBee was reared as a Quaker, and he continued to wear clothing of drab colors throughout his life. He regularly attended services of various denominations and remained private about his religious views, though he was baptized a Presbyterian shortly before his death.Smith, 96. McBee donated land in downtown Greenville for the Baptist, Methodist, Episcopal, and Presbyterian churches; and in Conestee he built an octagonal chapel for his workers. Although McBee was never a member, Christ Church Episcopal elected him to its vestry. McBee also contributed land for the construction of male and female academies, and when the Baptist Convention decided to move Furman University to Greenville, McBee sold it fifty choice acres along the Reedy River for perhaps half its market value.DeBow's, 317; Smith, 156, 240. Debow's described McBee as \\"small, with a mild and pleasing expression of face. In his manners, he is kind and gentle, with the simplicity of a child. Seldom is he excited by anything, but there is in him a sleeping passion, which is sometimes roused....In morality, and all the proprieties of life, Mr. McBee has no superior. His habits are all strictly temperate and methodical. He is a man of great industry and activity of life. He retires to bed early, and rises before daylight every morning. He breakfasts very early, and then employs himself in riding and superintending his business till dinner....[V]ery few men who have made their fortunes have appropriated so much of them to public purposes, and, to the support of honest industry, to the improvement of their country in her agriculture, manufactures. schools, houses, and public buildings, rail-roads, &c.....There; are some men whose judgment seems unerring, and who have an intuitive notion of success. Vardry McBee is one of that class, and like all truly great men, is without pride, ostentation, or pretension.\\"DeBow's, 317-18. Memorials Greenville has both a Vardry Street and a McBee Avenue. The octagonal church in Conestee is named for McBee.Helsley, 50. In 2002, a life-size bronze statue of McBee by sculptor T. J. Dixon was dedicated in downtown Greenville.John M.

Foundation Henry S. Lane was essential in organizing the People's Party in Indiana. Lane's influence over the older Whigs brought most into the People's Party, while abolitionists joined because of the anti- Kansas-Nebraska Act platform. Lane also helped to convince many Democrats and Know-Nothings who were opposed to slavery extension to join the People's Party. In 1854, the young Indiana party was more conservative than the national Republican Party. The People's Party resisted adopting the name \\"Republican\\" because of its association with the eastern abolition movement that many Hoosiers saw as too radical. In 1856, Lane chaired the People's Party Convention in Indianapolis and the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.

Dr. Lahey was nationally known in the U.S. medical profession, not only as a world-renowned surgeon, but also as a teacher of medicine, and a medical administrator.Lahey Clinic websiteMarvin Corman MD and Cornelius Sedgwick MD, \\"Reminiscences of Dr. Lahey\\", Abstract at Springer Inc. Education, career, and founding of Lahey Clinic \\"Usually referred to as the outstanding general surgeon in the world today, at times of crisis he was never known to lose either his head or his nerve,\\" stated the Boston Globe in 1953. \\"First and foremost he never allowed himself or his assistants to forget they had a human life in their hands. Surely but for him, thousands would not be alive today.\\" Although he prided himself on being a general surgeon, Lahey was well known for his expertise in thyroid and esophageal surgery, and surgery for stomach cancer and colon cancer. The \\"two-stage surgery\\" that he pioneered, in which surgery was completed in two steps over a period of two to four days, greatly improved surgical outcomes. In fact, his method decreased the mortality rate following thyroid surgery from 1-in-5 to 1-in-140. Like his father‚Äîwho was a granite cutter by trade and eventually became a wealthy bridge contractor‚ÄîLahey built his career from humble beginnings. Lahey attended high school in his hometown of Haverhill, Massachusetts, where he had his own newspaper route and worked at his father's firm. He then went on to attend Harvard Medical School, where he received a medical degree in 1904. After he served as intern and house surgeon at Long Island Hospital (1904-1905) and as a surgeon at Boston City Hospital (1905-1907), Lahey became resident surgeon of the Haymarket Relief Station (1908). He was on the surgical faculty of Harvard Medical School (1908-1909 and 1912-1915), and served as professor of surgery at Tufts University Medical School (1913-1917). Because of his educational influence, Lahey is often regarded as one of America's greatest teachers of surgery. In 1953, gastroenterologist Sara Jordan, MD, one of the first to join Lahey's practice, published an article in New England Journal of Medicine that noted: \\"His skill [brought] hundreds of surgeons from all parts of the world to see him operate and to share with him the knowledge and experience he was always ready to pass on to others.\\" During World War I, Lahey served as a major in the Army Medical Corps and director of surgery at Evacuation Hospital No. 30. After his return from military service, he opened a small practice on Beacon Street in Kenmore Square in Boston that became the Lahey Clinic in 1923. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Lahey to serve on a special commission to report on medical standards during World War II. This, and his extensive experience as a military surgeon, that strengthened Lahey's belief that anesthesia had created a new kind of surgery, which was best performed and refined by teams of surgical specialists. Lahey held many influential leadership positions, including president of the American Medical Association, New England Surgical Society, American College of Surgeons, and the International Society of Surgeons. He also operated on, or consulted with, many notables in his lifetime, including President Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a of Nicaragua, and Anthony Eden of Great Britain. In 1946, Lahey was awarded the Henry Jacob Bigelow Medal of the Boston Surgical Society in recognition of his surgical achievements. The life of Frank Lahey was summed up in a speech now in the United States Congressional Record. When the House of Representatives met shortly after his death on June 27, 1953, a memorial speech was delivered in his honor and concludes: \\"The medical profession has lost one of its greatest members. Massachusetts has lost a citizen who accepted with enthusiasm the broader responsibilities of his profession. The world has lost a man who was unequaled in his services to mankind.\\" Consultation with President Franklin D. Roosevelt In March 1944, Dr. Lahey was called to the White House to see President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Lahey ultimately advised Roosevelt not to seek a fourth term, since Roosevelt was suffering with serious illnesses, possibly including cancer and advanced heart disease, expressing serious doubt that Roosevelt could survive another four years in office. Lahey later agreed to suppress his report due to national security issues during wartime. Roosevelt died in April 1945, of what his attending physician said was a cerebral hemorrhage. Lahey's report on Roosevelt's illness was finally published many years after his death.David Steinberg MD, \\"Dr. Lahey's Dilemma\\", Boston Globe (May 29, 2011)WBUR's CommonHealth \\"Long-Lost 'Lahey Memo' on FDR's Health Unveiled\\" (April 8, 2011)Tim Coco, \\"Haverhill's Dr. Lahey Took FDR Secret to the Grave\\", WHAV Open Mike Show/Haverhill Heritage Series (July 20, 2014) References Bibliography *Harry S.

He has also designed 35 board wargames, several of them award-winning.  Life and career  Joseph Michael Balkoski was born in New York City on June 13, 1954, the son of Itala Tomasulo Balkoski and John Balkoski, a World War II veteran of the Pacific theater. He graduated from Great Neck South Senior High School in June 1971 and later from Vassar College in 1975. He received an M.A. in history from New York University in 1976. When he moved to Maryland in 1981, by chance he met many residents who were veterans of the D-Day invasion, all members of the 29th Infantry Division, which spearheaded the assault. His first book, Beyond the Beachhead: The 29th Infantry Division in Normandy, was published in 1988 and remains in print thirty years later, was defined by Charles M. Schulz, the creator of Peanuts, as \\"an amazing book... If you want to know what D-Day and Normandy were like, from private to general, from rifle to tank, from beginning to end, this is the book for you.\\" Balkoski's highly detailed series on the history of the 29th Division in World War II closed in 2015 with the publication of the fifth volume, The Last Roll Call, which recounts the end of the war in Europe and the GIs' return to civilian life. His thirty-year effort to detail the history of this celebrated outfit was praised by author Rick Atkinson, who described the series as \\"a magnificent achievement; the U.S. Army and the 29th Division are lucky to have an historian of Joe Balkoski's stature and skill to tell the tale of combat in Western Europe from the perspective of both the ordinary GI and his leaders.\\" In 2004, Balkoski published Omaha Beach, which meticulously documented the June 6, 1944, American invasion of that pivotal Normandy objective. Two years later, he released Utah Beach, which told the story of the amphibious and airborne operation in Normandy' Cotentin Peninsula on D-Day. The two-volume set was critically well received: the Wall Street Journal described Balkoski as \\"a true maestro of original D-Day history,\\" while USA Today categorized him as \\"the top living D-Day historian.\\"  Military and academia  Balkoski served for many years as the command historian of the Maryland National Guard, and runs the 29th Infantry Division Archives and Maryland Museum of Military History, both at the Fifth Regiment Armory in Baltimore, housing one of the finest collections in the United States of archival papers devoted to the World War II history of a single U.S. Army or Marine Corps division. In 2014, he designed the exhibit \\"When Freemen Shall Stand\\" at the Maryland Museum of Military History, which focused on the defense of Baltimore by Maryland citizen-soldiers in September 1814 against an attack by a British expeditionary force,an event that led to the writing of The Star Spangled Banner. In 2017, the 100th anniversary of American entry into World War I, he created the exhibit \\"Over There,\\" portraying the life of Marylanders both overseas and on the home front during the Great War. He has served as an adjunct professor in both the history and writing departments at the University of Baltimore and the Community College of Baltimore County. He frequently conducts battlefield staff rides in the U.S. and Europe for U.S. Army soldiers as part of their military training. Balkoski currently serves on the National Executive Committee of the 29th Division Association, which formulates and executes policy in support of all 29th Division veterans and their families; and the Maryland Military Monuments Commission, which oversees hundreds of military monuments within the state.

History The settlement was founded by Marcus and Wendel Wassmer. The Wassmer brothers were German-Canadian coopers who had immigrated from Baden to Toronto. Legend has it that in the spring of 1837, they walked south to this vicinity. Upon their return to Toronto in the summer, they found they no longer had jobs and returned on foot once again to the same grounds they had visited that spring. Their second arrival is said to have happened in the fall of 1837. The Wassmers secured some farmland, and their descendants still live there today. Prior to December, 1841, mass had been celebrated in St. Wendel parish from the time of its creation in the home of Martin Kohl, but in Christmas week of the year mentioned the congregation, composed of twenty families prepared the material and erected within five days a log structure as a house of worship.

He had an 8th Dan in karate, and was the winner of multiple European Karate Championships medals. Between 1998 and 2014 he was first Vice-President of the World Karate Federation. In 2011 Millerson was invested as a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau. Early life and sports career Millerson was born on 10 January 1953 in Aruba. He was partially of Surinamese descent. Millerson started to become interested in Wad≈ç-ry≈´ karate while studying in the Netherlands. He began to train under Jack van Hellemond who had been taught by sensei Ishikawa, the Japanese karate master. In 1973, he became the Dutch champion. Later that year, he won silver in the European Karate Championships. He would win the European championship two times. In 1975, Millerson won bronze in the 1975 World Championship. In 1976, Millerson became champion of Latin America in Guatemala and champion of the Caribbean in Santo Domingo. In 1997, Millerson became the President of the Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee. On 10 October 2010, the Netherlands Antilles dissolved, and Cura√ßao became a country within the Kingdom. On January 2011, the International Olympic Committee denied Cura√ßao permission to compete under their own flag, because it was not a fully independent country. Millerson argued for a similar status as Hong Kong. The IOC refused to reconsider their decision, because it would set a precedent, and England wanted to compete separately from the United Kingdom. Since then athletes from the Antilles either have to compete stateless, for Aruba, who was recognized prior to the new rules, or for the Netherlands. Millerson described the situation as the biggest blunder of the International Olympic Committee. Millerson was one of the founders of the Caribbean Karate Federation and served as its chairman from 1998 to 2014. He was chairman of the Panamerican Karate Federation from 1993 to 2013. Political career Millerson ran as a candidate for the Party for the Restructured Antilles in the 2017 Cura√ßao general election. On 11 May 2017 he was elected President of the Estates of Cura√ßao. All 19 members present voted for him. Millerson, suffering from cancer, resigned as President for health reasons on 3 June 2020, and was replaced by Ana-Maria Pauletta. On 4 June 2020, Millerson was hospitalized in the Netherlands. He told the Estates before leaving, \\"I'll be back,\\" however he died on 20 June 2020, aged 67.

It had candidates in the race, but later withdrew them.  Electoral lists  The alliance initially submitted electoral lists for all of the four constituencies. The alliance however refused to repeat costly medical examinations even for candidates already examined in February 2015, and went to the Administrative Court requesting free medical examination and a reopening of the candidate application. The court however upheld the requirement. After an appeal was turned down by Egypt's Supreme Administrative Court, the alliance withdrew all of its lists, forestalling their inevitable rejection by the High Election Commission.  Composition  Mostafa aimed to create electoral lists excluding the Muslim Brotherhood and former members of the National Democratic Party. 120 candidates will be selected to run. The 25-30 Alliance has stated that it is not part of the alliance. The parties affiliated with the National Front Alliance have joined the Reawakening of Egypt.

At President Jacob Zuma's 2015 State of the Nation Address, the president was interrupted by an opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, who demanded that he pay back the money used on his Nkandla homestead. South Africa also saw new xenophobic uprisings taking place, mainly targeted towards Africans from other countries. Foreigners were beaten, robbed and murdered during the attacks. The social protest Rhodes Must Fall started in 2015 at the University of Cape Town to protest for the removal of statues erected in South Africa during the colonial era depicting some of the well known colonists who settled in South Africa. In education, South Africa recorded a drop in its matric pass rate from 2013 to 2014. The protest #FeesMustFall was started towards the end of the year and achieved its primary goal of stopping an increase in university fees for 2016.

(c) Adult male calling by a stream; two tadpoles visible within the circle; (d) dorsal and ventral views of tadpoles released by a female at the moment of capture Limnonectes larvaepartus is a species of fanged frog in the family Dicroglossidae endemic to northern and western Sulawesi, Indonesia. It is unique in that it has internal fertilization and gives live birth to tadpoles. Other frog species that have live birth produce froglets. Discovery The frog was first mentioned in 1994 under the nomen nudum \\"Limnonectes ovovivipar\\", which refers to ovovivipary, whereby the tadpoles hatch from their eggs while still inside their mother. In 2014, it was formally named and described by Djoko Iskandar, Ben Evans, and Jim McGuire. Its specific name is derived from larvae + Latin partus (give birth). The authors collected over 100 specimens for their study and witnessed either direct birth of tadpoles or tadpoles in the oviducts on 19 occasions. They also observed free-living tadpoles in stream-side puddles. In 2015, the International Institute for Species Exploration names it as one of the \\"Top 10 New Species\\" for new species discovered in 2014. Characteristics The average male size (from tip of snout to cloaca) is , while the average female size is . Within Sulawesi, it has been found in the Northern Peninsula and on the western edge of the central core. The dorsum is typically brownish-grey, but can also be reddish-brown or golden-tan. The underside may be yellowish or cream, with a dark spot often marking the upper end of the tibia. Females produce approximately 100 eggs, which hatch as tadpoles in the oviducts and are probably retained there until exhausting their supply of yolk. Apart from yolk, the oviductal tadpoles may also feed on feces and dead siblings. The tadpoles are birthed into slow-moving streams. They feature well-developed tails, mouthparts and pigmentation at birth. After birth, tadpoles likely self-feed even before metamorphosis into froglets. The oviducts have no obvious specializations to accommodate the tadpoles, raising the possibility that the unique breeding mode is the result of a simple behavioral change in fertilization method. It is not known how internal fertilization occurs, as the male frog has no obvious intromittent organ.

She departed Cleveland to serve as Principal Harp for the Roxy Theater Orchestra in New York City. She later played for the NBC Radio Symphony Orchestra, and served as Principal Harp for the Metropolitan Opera, while simultaneously performing weekly solo recital programs on several national radio networks. After an early retirement from the Metropolitan Opera, she continued performing for several opera companies, including the Lyric Opera of Chicago, in Montreal under Leonard Pelletier, and in Bogota. She was recorded performing in Wonder Tidings, a Christmas work by the composer John LaMontaine for solo harp, choir and narrator. There are also historic recordings of her playing in the library of the American Harp Society. She participated in the Memorial Concert for Carlos Salzedo, produced by Gerald Goodman, which took place in New York's Town Hall in 1962, the recording of which was released in limited distribution.

Together with his wife Kashiko Kawakita and daughter Kazuko Kawakita, he was instrumental in the development of the Japanese film industry, sponsoring actors and actresses, and in promoting Japanese cinema to overseas audiences. pages 125-128  Biography   Early life  Kawakita was born in Tokyo. His father, Kawakita Daijiro, a highly decorated officer in the Imperial Japanese Army during the Russo-Japanese War, and subsequently an instructor at the Baoding Military Academy in Beijing, was killed under mysterious circumstances, possibly for treason by Japanese agents. pages 95-98 Following graduation from high school in Japan, Kawakita travelled to China in 1922 to study at Beijing University and continued on to Heidelberg in Germany for further studies. He was hired by the German movie company Universum Film AG and sent back to Japan as its representative.  Pre-war career  Kawakita formed his own company, Towa Trading in October 1928. He met his wife, Kashiko, when she came to work at the company as his secretary, and they used their honeymoon in 1932 to make the first of many trips to Europe to acquire movies for the Japanese market. Among his earliest successes were Leontine Sagan's M√§dchen in Uniform, although he also worked with many other European directors, including G. W. Pabst, Ren√© Clair, Fritz Lang and Julien Duvivier. The films Kawakita imported were released to the market via Toho Studios. Kawakita also brought Japanese films to the Venice Film Festival and other overseas venues. In 1937, he played an important role in the 1937 German-Japanese joint venture The Daughter of the Samurai, directed by Arnold Fanck and Mansaku Itami. In the 1938 Venice International Film Festival, Five Scouts (Gonin no sekk≈çhei) by Tomotaka Tasaka was nominated best film, the first time a Japanese film had won a major award at an overseas film festival. page 121 In 1938, Kawakita, who was fluent in Chinese as well as in German, turned his attention to China, working on a Sino-Japanese joint venture, The Road to Peace in the Orient, directed by Shigeyoshi Suzuki, investing much of his own capital in a project which he hoped would project Sino-Japanese harmony. However, the film was a commercial failure as the Chinese public say Kawakita as a mouthpiece of the Japanese military and the Japanese found the Chinese language movie with Japanese subtitled hard to understand. The Japanese Army then asked Kawakita to head the newly formed China United Productions Ltd. (or \\"Zhonglian\\" for short); a merger between Xinhua Film Company and eleven other Shanghai studios. Kawakita initially hesitated, but realized that the project would proceed with or without him. The studio produced movies with local staff and actors aimed at local Chinese audiences, and had a staff of over 3000 employees. Although Kawakita maintained relations with high-ranking officials in the Japanese military and the Nanjing Nationalist government (Shanghai mayor Chen Gongbo as honorary president), he insisted that the company act independently and to continue to pursue entertainment themes over propaganda, and thus often encountered opposition from Japanese censors and military officials, so much so that there were rumors of a plot by the Kwantung Army or of the Kempeitai page 42 to assassinate him.  Post-war career  After the surrender of Japan, Kawakita returned to Japan, where he was arrested by the American occupation forces and charged as a Class-B war criminal; however, he was soon released after the authorities received many statements in his defense from Chinese and Jews he had protected while in Shanghai. He was permitted to resume his position as president of Towa Trading in 1950, and changed the company name to Toho-Towa in 1951. He continued to make efforts to promote Japanese cinema overseas, and screened Rashomon by Akira Kurosawa at the Venice Film Festival in 1951 where it won the Golden Lion award. He was production supervisor for the 1953 American-Japanese joint venture Anatahan, directed by Josef von Sternberg. pages 251-253 In 1960, Kawakita established the Japan Film Library Council to promote Japanese cinema overseas and to make materials available to foreign researchers. He also was a founder of the Japan Art Theatre Guild, to promote international art film to Japan. His daughter, Kazuko Kawakita became an assistant to Akira Kurosawa on the 1960 film The Bad Sleep Well. She later married actor Juzo Itami. Kawakita was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasures, 2nd class, in 1973. He died on May 24, 1981. Following his death, the Kawakita Award was created in 1983 to honor individuals or organizations who have contributed to the promotion of Japanese cinema overseas. Its first recipient was Donald Richie. His former home in Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan has been turned into a memorial museum.

Premise Singers, dancers, musicians and other performers competed for cash prizes in this early Canadian talent show, replacing the 1952‚Äì54 series Now's Your Chance. Canada Packers was the series sponsor. The competition for the first two seasons was structured as six sets of six episodes each. In each set, there were five episodes of general competitions. The winners of each of these episodes competed in a sixth semi-final episode. Following these 36 episodes were two episodes in which the semi-final winners competed, an finally a 39th episode in which two grand prize winners were determined. For the first two seasons, contestants were judged by a panel at the studio. Semi-finalists were determined by mail sent by viewers. For the first season, panelists included Midge Arthur (wife and partner of entertainer and producer Jack Arthur), Herman Geiger-Torel (Royal Conservatory of Music), Clyde Gilmour (film critic) and Ernest Rawley (Royal Alexandra Theatre manager). Production The half- hour series aired on Tuesday nights throughout its run, in either a 9 or 9:30 p.m. time slot. 1954-55 season The first episode of Pick the Stars began on 28 September 1954 in its regular 9 p.m. Tuesday schedule. For the first two seasons, Dick MacDougal (Tabloid) hosted the series while Samuel Hersenhoren conducted the house orchestra. Drew Crossan produced the first season. $500 cash prizes were awarded to semi-final winners, for example Quebec singer Denise Anger won a semi-final on 29 March 1955. Competitions of the semi-final winners were broadcast on 7 and 14 June 1955. The judging panel featured Jack Arthur, Leslie Bell, Clyde Gilmour, Gweneth Lloyd and Ruth Lowe. Irene Andrian and Pat Morgan won the $1000 grand prizes on 21 June 1955 season finale at the Eaton Auditorium. Andrian was a singer who was already featured on CBC's Tzigane series while Morgan was a night club singer and presenter. During the first season, Globe and Mail entertainment columnist Alex Barris noted an incident in which host Dick MacDougal wished a contestant with the words \\"good luck\\". However, MacDougal was reportedly forbidden from using that phrase since it was the brand name of a margarine product that competed with sponsor Canada Packers. 1955-56 season The second season began on 27 September 1955, in a 9:30 p.m. Tuesday time slot. The set was updated to resemble a living room. Jim Guthro was the new series producer in the second season. Robert Goulet competed on the show in November 1955. He earned a first place tie on that episode with Margot Leclair, a singer from Montreal. Also in November 1955, conductor Sammy Hersenhoren's baton slipped, causing a significant self-inflicted injury to his right eye, although he continued to conduct until the end of the episode. The second season concluded with a 19 June 1956 broadcast from Toronto's Odeon-Carlton Theatre. The grand prize winners were Vancouver singer Lorraine Foreman and British singers and dancers Peggy and Pat Doyle. 1956-57 season CBC made unsuccessful attempts to broadcast the series from Toronto's Loews-Uptown theatre for the third season. Instead, the production originated from CBC's Studio 4 for its 25 September 1956 season debut. Pat Morgan, a 1955 grand prize winner, became the new series host. Lucio Agostini returned from music projects in the United States and replaced Hersenhoren as the series band conductor. The judging system was changed for the third and final season of Pick the Stars. Three judges were now located in various Canadian cities outside the studio and communicated their votes through telephone calls. There was no longer a competition for the entire season but rather winners were determined per episode. An applause meter was also used to determine winners. Auditions for potential contestants were conducted throughout Canada in late 1956, including St. John's, Newfoundland. The episode on 25 December 1956 was produced at the Winnipeg Auditorium. Episodes aired Tuesdays at 9:30 p.m. Its finale on 25 June 1957 featured performers Brian Beaton (folk singer), Reginald Bryant (singer), Nicholas Genovese (tenor singer) and Helen Valenaks (piano).

Rhodes is known for her artworks related to the landscape, which take two forms: outdoor works, in which she makes minimal sculptural interventions in the landscape, which exist only through her documentation, and sculptural installations in gallery spaces, which are conceptually related to the outdoor works. Education and travel Rhodes was born in 1937 in Christchurch, New Zealand. In 1959 she attended the University of Canterbury's School of Fine Arts part-time. In 1960 she moved to Wellington, and took the Basic Studies Art Course at the Wellington Polytechnic School of Design. In 1961 she moved to Westport and lived there until 1965. From 1965 to 1969 Rhodes lived and travelled in Africa and Europe. She lived in Nigeria for 18 months, where she worked on terracotta sculpture, pottery, and bronze casting with a traditional bronze caster. From she 1967 lived in Kent, England and travelled around England, Wales and Scotland, returning to New Zealand by way of Greece and India. In 1971 Rhodes enrolled part-time again at the Canterbury University School of Fine Arts, and completed her Diploma in Fine Arts (Sculpture) in 1974. She attended Teachers College in 1976 and taught part-time briefly, but stopped to focus full-time on her art practice. Work While at art school in the 1970s Rhodes began working outdoors, becoming one of New Zealand's few environmental sculptors. Rhodes' work takes two main forms: sculptural installations in buildings, usually art galleries, using materials that have often been modified through exposure to the elements (such as paper stained with rusted metal), and ephemeral outdoor interventions, where contrasting coloured elements and forms (such as dyed cloth or coloured rods) are placed in the landscape, photographed by the artist, and then removed. While Rhodes has made outdoors works in New Zealand and Britain, most have taken place in Banks Peninsula, Canterbury, the area in which she lives. Rhodes has developed her own terms for these two kinds of works, both of which she sees as being about space. 'Extensums' are usually outdoor works, which 'extend' a space in Rhodes' terms; 'intensums' are usually installations inside buildings, where space is intensifed. Rhodes began training as a cross-country runner in 1978 and went on to compete regularly in marathon and cross-country events. In 1998 art historian Priscilla Pitts wrote: > Every day she runs long distances on the hills, often along Summit Road, > 'absorbing the landforms' not just with her eyes, but also through the soles > of her feet. She becomes kinetically intimate with the landscape, her whole > body responding to the varying nature of the terrain. In response to this > way of understanding the land, some works involve upright 'markers' across > the chosen site; others construct paths from squares and strips of material; > other indicate the lie of the land using a succession of long horizontal > elements. Career Although she did not have her first exhibition until 1977, when she was 40, Rhodes quickly established herself with projects in public galleries throughout New Zealand. In 1980 Rhodes contributed Extensions to the Sarjeant Gallery's 4 New Zealand Sculptors exhibition (which also included Andrew Drummond, Neil Dawson and Matt Pine). Working in space under the gallery's well-known dome, Rhodes installed a floor piece made from squares of weathered steel laid out through the galleries from under the dome and extending into the grounds outside. In 1981 as part of ANZART, the first Australia-New Zealand artist exchange, Rhodes presented a work titled Stained Silences at the Robert McDougall Art Gallery. She covered a long wall in the gallery with stained squares of newspaper and gave her first slide talk on her outdoors work as part of the exhibition events programme. In 1982 Rhodes was included with Christine Hellyar and Jacqueline Fraser in 3 Sculptors at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington. She constructed two walls of rust-stained newsprint sheets attached to lengths of cane, which formed a corridor and shook subtly when visitors passed between them. In the same year she presented an installation work, Extensums: ground runs - stained ground, at the F1 Sculpture Project, in which chalk and water marks drew attention to details in the factory floor surface, and the space was filled with large pieces of paper stained by rusting steel, upright curved grids and lime green rods. In 1985 Rhodes exhibited in the Auckland Art Gallery's artist project series. Her installation, titled Intensums '85, filled a long gallery with a three-dimensional grid like a labyrinth, made of a wide variety of materials including steel rods, cane, green painted cane, paper, fabric, copper wire and dried beach grass, all stained with rust, and small boxes of earth which sprouted grass during the exhibition. Rhodes took part in a number of other notable exhibitions in the 1980s and 1990s, including Content/context: a survey of recent New Zealand art (1986, organised by the National Art Gallery), Alter/Image: a different view, women artists in New Zealand 1973‚Äì1993 (1993, City Gallery Wellington and Auckland City Art Gallery), and Action replay: post-object art (1998, Artspace, Auckland) and had solo projects at a number of galleries, including Intensum/Extensum (1986, Govett- Brewster Art Gallery, Extensum ‚Äì soft ground and Paper works: stained ground (1987, Artspace, Auckland), INTENSUM in memorium (1987, Wellington City Art Gallery), INTENSUM: stained silences, interconnections (1998, Govett-Brewster Art Gallery), and In-between (McDougall Contemporary Art Annex, Christchurch), and made the site-specific sculpture Ziggurat 2000 in Hagley Park, Christchurch, for the Art and Industry Biennial. In 2003 the Adam Art Gallery in Wellington staged the exhibition Conduits and containers: Leakages from the tests, curated by Christina Barton, to accompany the publication of Barton‚Äôs book on Rhodes‚Äô work from 1977 to 2000, Ground/Work: The Art of Pauline Rhodes (2003, Victoria University Press). Rhodes' private archive and documentation of her work was destroyed in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. In 2015 Rhodes created a new, site-specific, temporary outdoor artwork for the 2015 SCAPE Biennial in Christchurch. The work made use of mass-produced industrial components which will be returned to the manufacturers at the end of the festival. In early 2016 Rhodes created a site-specific installation, Dark Watch, at Auckland's ST Paul St Gallery. Critic John Hurrell compared the work to some of the artist's installations from the early 1980s, such as Extensum/Extensor at Christchurch's CSA in 1983. An accompanying publication, also titled Dark Watch, features essays by Charlotte Huddleston, Tina Barton, Ash Kilmartin and Rebecca Boswell. Awards and recognitions In 1987 Rhodes was the first recipient of the Olivia Spencer Bower Award. Collections Because her work is largely temporary and site-specific, few of Rhodes' works are held in public collections. One large sculptural work, Extensum/Extensor (1982) is in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa: the artist stipulated that the work could only be purchased if she could personally control how it was presented in future. Both Te Papa and the Christchurch Art Gallery hold drawings by Rhodes and photographic recordings of her outdoor works.

It was first organized in 1681 by the Kangxi Emperor at the imperial hunting grounds at Mulan (modern-day Weichang Manchu and Mongol Autonomous County, near what would become the summer residence of the Qing emperors at Chengde. Starting in 1683 the event was held annually at Mulan during the autumn, lasting up to a month. The Qing dynasty hunt was a synthesis of earlier Chinese and Inner Asian hunting traditions, particularly those of the Manchus and Mongols. The emperor himself participated in the hunt, along with thousands of soldiers, imperial family members, and government officials. The Manchu emperors of the Qing dynasty used the hunt as a military exercise to train their troops in the traditional martial skills of archery and horsemanship. The hunt was also a bonding ritual intended to emphasize the shared Inner Asian martial traditions of the Manchu and Mongol soldiers of the Eight Banners who were selected to participate (Han Chinese troops were excluded from the hunt). The event provided an opportunity for Qing emperors to leave the confines of the Forbidden City in Beijing and return to the forests \\"north of the wall\\", closer to their ancestral homelands, where they could hunt and live as their ancestors did. As the Manchus grew accustomed to living in Chinese cities, Qing emperors expanded and ritualized the imperial hunt as a sort of invented tradition, using it to preserve the traditional Manchu way of life. The Qianlong Emperor made it a key element of his effort to halt the steady decline of military discipline within the Eight Banners during his reign. Each year, for the duration of the hunt, Mulan served as a temporary capital and a venue for diplomatic activities. The Qianlong Emperor required the leaders of Inner Asian tributary states to join in the hunt on a rotating basis, and he frequently received foreign emissaries there rather than in the imperial palace at Beijing. To facilitate the continued operation of the imperial government in the emperor's absence, many government officials accompanied the emperor to Mulan, where they lived and worked in a tent city replicating the layout of the Forbidden City, exchanging correspondence regularly with Beijing and Chengde. Altogether, the Kangxi, Qianlong, and Jiaqing Emperors participated in 91 hunts during their reigns. As an important element of Qing military culture, and an embodiment of Manchu identity, the Qing imperial hunt featured regularly in the official artwork and poetry of the Qing dynasty. It was the subject of several paintings by Giuseppe Castiglione, the Italian Jesuit who served as a court painter to Qianlong. Images of the hunt, much like images commemorating victories in battle and other military subjects, were regularly commissioned by the imperial court as a form of propaganda, portraying Qing emperors as exemplars of traditional martial (wu) values. Origins Chinese Hunting has been an important element of Chinese elite identity since at least the Zhou dynasty. Hunting, warfare, and animal sacrifice were intimately linked in the culture of the Zhou aristocracy. As Chinese society became progressively more agrarian, hunting was transformed into a ritual activity associated with the elite. Because the bow and arrow were used both for hunting and for waging war, the practice of archery became a defining trait of the proper gentleman of the Zhou period. A common theme throughout Chinese history is the juxtaposition of hunting and warfare. As one Zhou dynasty writer put it: :Therefore one uses the spring hunt, the summer hunt, the autumn hunt, and the winter hunt, all in the intervals between agricultural labor, to practice the [great] services. Every three years there should be a review of the troops... The lord does not shoot any bird or beast whose flesh is not offered in the sacrificial pots or whose hide, teeth, bones, horns, fur, or feathers are not used on the sacrificial vessels. In the classic 14th century novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Chancellor Cao Cao of the Han dynasty states: \\"The kings and emperors of ancient times held four grand hunts yearly, riding forth from the capital each season to show the world their prowess.\\" These four seasonal hunts were the spring hunt (), summer hunt (), autumn hunt, and winter hunt (). Such ritual hunts were regular events in the Tang dynasty, and were sometimes criticized for their extravagance. Emperors, however, saw hunting as an important military exercise. Emperor Taizong of Tang defended his frequent hunting, saying: \\"At present the empire is without trouble, but military preparations cannot be forgotten.\\" Kublai Khan out hunting Inner Asian Although it was known by the same Chinese name (qiuxian) as the autumn hunts of Chinese antiquity, the autumn hunt of the Qing dynasty was more directly influenced by the hunting practices of the Inner Asian horse cultures. The Manchus who conquered the Ming dynasty and founded the Qing were themselves part of that tradition. The Qing empire encompassed not only Manchus but also Mongols, Turkic peoples, and other steppe nomads. Like the Mongols of the Yuan dynasty and the Khitans of the Liao dynasty, the Manchus of the Qing practiced a form of battue hunting, in which groups of soldiers would encircle a large area of forest and drive their prey into clearings where they could be shot. This style of hunting was called aba in Manchu. As recorded by Marco Polo, Kublai Khan had a hunting preserve near his summer capital at Xanadu (Shangdu). The khan hunted there regularly during his reign. Mongol and Khitan khans considered hunting an important form of military training, and practiced it regularly. For steppe nomads like themselves, hunting was still an important part of daily life, and not just an idle pursuit of the upper classes as it had become among the Han Chinese. Emperor Taizong of the Khitan Liao dynasty echoed Emperor Taizong of Tang when he remarked, \\"Our hunting is not merely the pursuit of enjoyment, but a means of practicing warfare!\\" The Jurchens of the Jin dynasty, ancestors of the Manchus, organized their military units along the same lines as their hunting parties. This practice was carried on by the Manchus. From these units emerged the companies, called niru (\\"arrow\\"), that formed the basic building blocks of the Eight Banners military system that went on to conquer China. The pre-conquest Manchus participated frequently in organized hunts. In 1630, before the capture of Beijing, Hong Taiji established a hunting ground near the old Qing capital of Mukden (Shenyang). However, it was his grandson the Kangxi Emperor who would start the tradition of regular annual hunts. The Mulan hunting preserve Saihanba National Forest Park, which encompasses part of the old hunting grounds Establishment The tradition of hunting at Mulan in the autumn came about as the result of Kangxi's 1681 hunting expedition in lands belonging to his Mongol allies, near the site of the former Yuan capital Shangdu. These lands were gifted to Kangxi at the end of his visit. In 1683, Kangxi returned to hunt again and the lands were established as an official hunting preserve, and bounded by a willow palisade. Environment The hunting preserve was located in Rehe (Jehol) province, which has since been divided among the provinces of Hebei, Liaoning, and Inner Mongolia. It occupied a densely forested area where Mongols had hunted for generations. The area contained 67 clearings, called hoihan in Manchu, that animals could be driven into as part of the aba hunt. These clearings usually had Mongolian names, reflecting the area's history as a traditional Mongol hunting ground. For much of its history, it was known simply as \\"the hunting ground at Rehe\\". The Chinese name Mulan () is a phonetic translation of the Manchu term muran, which refers to a hunting method in which hunters would whistle for deer, using decoy deer heads as a lure. An 1807 inscription by the Jiaqing Emperor refers to the hunting preserve as Mulan/Muran, and today the area is called Mulan Weichang (). It is located in Weichang Manchu and Mongol Autonomous County in Hebei. During the Kangxi era, plentiful game was to be found at Mulan. The emperor was able to hunt not only deer, but also tigers, bears, leopards, and wolves. Qing emperors enjoyed the beauty of the natural environment, and the escape it provided them from urban life in the capital. As Kangxi wrote: :I am fine. Right now there is no business. At this cool place outside the passes, everyone, from soldiers down to errand-runners, has set up their tents. We've been living here eating game and fish from the mountains and rivers. At night I cover myself with just a cotton blanket. The rainfall has been just right. My mind and heart are tranquil. Lord Macartney, who visited the Qianlong Emperor at Rehe in 1793 during the Macartney Embassy, gave the following account of the area: :It is one of the finest forest scenes in the world, wild, woody, mountainous and rocky, abounding with stags and deer of different species, and most of the other beasts of chace, not dangerous to man... In many places immense woods, chiefly oaks, pines, and chestnuts, grow upon perpendicular steeps... These woods often clamber over the loftiest pinnacles of the stony hills or, gathering on the skirts of them, descend with a rapid sweep and bury themselves in the deepest vallies. Within the preserve Macartney also found \\"palaces, banquetting houses, and monasteries,\\" accessed by roads \\"hewn out of the living rock\\". From a hilltop pavilion, he saw around him \\"so rich, so various, so beautiful, so sublime a prospect [his] eyes had ever beheld\\". In the later years of the Qianlong era and in the Jiaqing era, however, illegal poaching and logging in the preserve became a serious issue. Jiaqing observed in the early 1800s that the damage to the local ecosystem had made it very difficult to hunt there. Administration In 1705, the Kangxi Emperor created a hunting office within the Eight Banners to manage the preserve at Mulan. The headquarters of its Chief Controller was located in Chengde. All but one of the officials who held this position were Manchus, the one exception being a Mongol. In 1749, responsibility over Mulan was given over to the Lifan Yuan, which supervised the Qing dynasty's Mongolian dependencies. The Qianlong Emperor increased the number of officials at Mulan in 1753. During his reign, the number of hunting guards increased from 191 to 800. The number again increased to 950 under the Jiaqing Emperor. Hunting guards at Mulan were selected among bannermen from the capital, and were responsible for preventing poaching, squatting, and illegal logging, as well as for managing the wildlife in Mulan's sixty-seven (later seventy-two) hunting zones. With few exceptions, all permanent construction was banned in the preserve. In 1764, responsibility for Mulan was given back to the Eight Banners, under the lieutenant general of the Rehe garrison. Throughout its history, the administration of the Mulan preserve was staffed entirely with Manchus and Mongols. History Kangxi era The first hunt at Mulan was in 1681, when the Kangxi Emperor hunted there as a guest of his Mongol allies. With him on that occasion were 3,000 Mongol riders, a small number of bannermen of the Eight Banners, and a retinue of officials from Beijing. After receiving the land as a gift from the Mongols, Kangxi hunted there each year starting with his second visit in 1683. Participation in the hunt was expanded to include troops from the Eight Banners of Beijing and the Banner garrisons of Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jingzhou, and Xi'an. The best archers and riders of each garrison were selected to participate, based on their performance on tests earlier in the year. Only Manchu and Mongol bannermen could be selected, reflecting the hunt's Inner Asian character. Hunts were large-scale affairs involving thousands of participants; in addition to bannermen, there were Mongol princes and government officials present. Kangxi had delicacies such as strawberries grown near the grounds so they could be enjoyed by his hunting party. The construction of the Chengde Mountain Resort in Rehe began during Kangxi's reign. The resort was established as a summer residence for the Qing emperors. Its location was north of the Great Wall, halfway between the wall and the hunting grounds at Mulan. Each year, the emperor would depart Chengde during the autumn and travel with his entourage to Mulan, a distance of seventy-five miles. Although Chengde was said to be a place to escape the heat of Beijing in the summer, in fact Kangxi usually stayed there into autumn, and sometimes returned in the winter. Except when he was away on campaign, Kangxi hunted annually at Mulan until his death in 1722. In his later years, Kangxi insisted on continuing to hunt, despite needing to be carried in a sedan chair. Kangxi's son, the Yongzheng Emperor, never hunted at Mulan as an emperor, though he had done so as a prince. Yongzheng regretted his failure to continue the custom, and instructed his sons to maintain their hunting skills. Qianlong era The next emperor to hunt at Mulan was Qianlong, who revived and expanded his grandfather's tradition. Mulan held deep significance for Qianlong, who erected a stele there in 1751. Concerned about the disappearance of traditional Manchu ways in his generation, he wrote to one of his generals, \\"From the third year [of my reign] the former institution of the regular training hunt will be begun. Only then will I know whether you have truly practiced as you have preached.\\" From the emperor's point of view, the hunt was the only way to maintain the skills of his troops at shooting from horseback. The Qianlong Emperor held over forty hunts in his reign, and received foreign dignitaries at Chengde when he was away from the capital. Hunts were usually cancelled in years when the emperor visited the imperial tombs at Mukden, or for important diplomatic events. The visits to Chengde of Amursana in 1754, the Sixth Panchen Lama in 1780, and Lord Macartney in 1793 all resulted in such cancellations. As a venue for such visits, Chengde's location north of the wall and its proximity to the hunting grounds emphasized the Inner Asian heritage of the Manchus and made it the ideal location to receive emissaries from the societies of Central Asia. Jiaqing era Like his father Qianlong, the Jiaqing Emperor considered the Mulan hunt to be of vital importance. The inscription of his 1807 stele (\\"Record of Mulan\\") at the hunting preserve, placed near that of his father, stated that \\"Mulan is our nation's hunting ground.\\" Jiaqing reaffirmed the hunt's importance as both a representation of Manchu identity and as a form of military training. Acknowledging that his own riding and shooting skills were probably inferior to those of his father, he proclaimed, \\"I surely will not take up idle, leisurely ways.\\" In the final words of his inscription, the Jiaqing Emperor wrote: :Can the son who is heir to the house betray the aims of his ancestors? Hunting at Muran in the autumn is the eternal way that must not be forgotten, but preserved for all time by generation after generation of sons and grandsons. Jiaqing, however, was the last emperor to hunt regularly at Mulan. His son, the Daoguang Emperor, discontinued the practice after ascending the throne, and no more hunts would occur thereafter. Events and activities Journey from Beijing Qing dynasty map of Chengde Mountain Resort In the early years of the Kangxi era, before the construction of the Chengde complex at his behest, the emperor would travel directly to Mulan in the fall. Kangxi's entourage lived off the land, hunting and camping along the route to Mulan. The emperor wrote of roasting venison over an open fire, and making tea with melted snow. On his 1711 trip, after construction had begun at Chengde, it is estimated that 12,000 people may have accompanied him from the resort. During Qianlong's reign, the emperor's usual practice was to first go to Chengde in the summer, and then proceed to the hunting grounds later in the year. Before departing for Chengde, the emperor and the imperial family would participate in ceremonies in Beijing. Tibetan lamas were present to pray for the success of the hunt. The emperor would usually return to Beijing just after the end of the hunting season. The trip to Chengde from Beijing took seven days, with the emperor and his large entourage stopping at lodges stationed along the way. According to Lord Macartney, whose party took this route to reach Chengde in 1793, each day's segment of the trip was short enough to be completed by mid-day or afternoon. Macartney estimated the distance from Beijing to be about 131.5 miles. There were two parallel roads between Beijing and Chengde, one for the emperor and one for other authorized persons. While traveling the route, Macartney observed a large number of troops repairing the road in anticipation of the emperor's return trip to Beijing. The road was known to become muddy after heavy summer rains, as observed by the Jesuit painter Jean Denis Attiret. It crossed several rivers, at which bridges or ferries were provided. In some areas, Macartney found the road \\"very rough\\" and difficult to travel. Along the route were guard posts at approximately five mile intervals, each staffed by a handful of soldiers to provide security. Hunting Detail from Hongli Spearing a Tiger Scheduled hunting activities at Mulan included both the eponymous muran variety as well as large-scale aba hunts. Several thousand soldiers were required for the aba hunt. A temporary imperial camp would be placed north of the hunting site. On the day of the hunt, the participants would be split into a left wing and a right wing, arrayed in two semi-circular groups spread out over a distance of several miles. Once the two semi-circles had joined, the wing leaders would order the men to close in. The circle would then be reduced to a size of two or three li in circumference, gathering the prey within. The emperor, having arrived at the campsite by this point, entered the enclosure on horseback and had the honor of the first shot. To protect him from potentially dangerous game such as bears or tigers, the emperor would be accompanied by a number of troops such as the \\"tiger-gun brigade\\". If a tiger was caught, the emperor usually killed it personally, as part of the spectacle demonstrating the bravery and martial skill of the imperial lineage. In 1692, the Kangxi Emperor killed a bear by wounding it with an arrow and finishing it off with a pike. Under the Kangxi Emperor, tiger hunts were conducted by having captive animals brought in cages, and then releasing them into the hunting grounds. Official business While the emperor was hunting at Mulan, the business of government continued. The \\"traveling camp\\" of the imperial government was arranged so as to mirror the layout of the government offices around the Forbidden City. Messengers relayed information between Beijing, the Chengde resort, and Mulan, allowing the emperors and his entourage of imperial officials to do their work in the field. According to one official, there were no desks in the tents, and work had to be done by candlelight. Entertainment At the end of the hunting season, the emperor held a feast for all participants, followed by a special feast just for Mongol and Uyghur leaders. Such events were an opportunity for the emperor to spend time with his Inner Asian subjects, many of whom did not travel south to China proper for fear of smallpox. In addition to banquets, the emperor also presented and received gifts, and gave out titles. Many entertainments were provided, including archery and wrestling contests, as well as mock battles. Lord Macartney, in his 1793 mission, observed wrestling, acrobatics, juggling, theatre, and fireworks displays, but was disappointed that an expected display of feats of horsemanship did not appear, as he had heard that the \\"Tartars\\", as he called them, were quite skilled in such arts. During the performances, Macartney noted that the audience was completely silent. Macartney, eager to get on with his diplomatic mission, was nonetheless obliged by court etiquette to watch these displays and receive gifts from the emperor throughout the day. Political significance Propaganda Detail from Portrait of the Emperor Troating for Deer, by Giuseppe Castiglione (1741) The hunts at Mulan were commemorated in paintings produced by the imperial court, much like other military rituals of the Qing. This was especially true in the Qianlong era, in which commemorative art also portrayed the triennual grand inspections (dayue) of Eight Banners troops, and the dual rituals of dispatching armies (mingjiang) and welcoming their return (jiaolao). These works of art, as well as the activities depicted in them, all formed part of the Qianlong Emperor's propaganda campaign to promote martial values in Qing society. Many of these paintings were done under the direction of Giuseppe Castiglione, the Jesuit missionary who served as one of Qianlong's court painters. A number of paintings produced during Qianlong's reign portray the emperor himself participating in the autumn hunt at Mulan, as well as in the other military rituals of the Qing. In particular, Castiglione produced a series of four scroll paintings about the Mulan hunt. He and his apprentices also produced a number of horse paintings, reviving a subject that had not been popular since the Tang dynasty. A Kazakh horse presented as a gift to the Qianlong Emperor serves as his mount in Castiglione's painting of the grand inspection of the troops, as well as in paintings of the emperor hunting. Copies of martially- themed paintings were disseminated widely in a variety of formats, conveying a message of military might both at home and abroad, as well as impressing a martial stamp upon domestic mass culture. Diplomacy and ethnic policy Lord Macartney's embassy to China, 1793 Mulan, and later Chengde, also played an important diplomatic role. It was at Chengde that Qianlong received the Macartney Embassy, cutting short his hunting trip to do so. As part of the Qing emperors' patronage of Tibetan Buddhism, several temples were built in the Tibetan style around Chengde, including the Puning Temple (1755, modeled after Samye Monastery), and the Putuo Zongcheng Temple (1771, modeled after the Potala Palace). It was also at Chengde that the Sixth Panchen Lama visited Qianlong in 1780, for which occasion the Xumi Fushou Temple was erected. At the hunting sites of Mulan, the Kangxi Emperor met with Khalkha, Kharchin, and D√∂rbet leaders. Likewise, Qianlong often pronounced edicts affecting Inner Asians at the hunting grounds. The hunt itself, its proximity to the Yuan dynasty summer capital of the Mongols, the practice of living in tents or yurts, and the banquets held in honor of Mongol officials, all served to ingratiate the emperors of the Qing dynasty with their ethnic Mongol subjects and allies in particular, as well as Inner Asians generally. From the beginning of the Qing dynasty, Manchu emperors positioned themselves not only as the emperors of China, but also as Great Khans in the mold of Genghis and Kublai. Originally the khan of the later Jin dynasty, Hong Taiji renamed his empire the Great Qing and declared himself its emperor in 1636 after receiving the surrender of the Chahar Mongols. The Qing sponsorship of Tibetan Buddhism was inherited from the Mongol tradition. The secondary capital and its hunting grounds, both outside the Great Wall, thus bolstered the Qing emperors' rhetoric of having brought the inner (Chinese) and outer (Mongol, Tibetan, Uyghur and so on) peoples together into one \\"family\\" (neiwai yijia). As ritual The Qianlong Emperor Hunting Hare by Giuseppe Castiglione (1755) The Qing dynasty imperial hunts became increasingly elaborate and ritualized over time, particularly under the Qianlong Emperor. As hunting became uncommon among the Manchus, the majority of whom lived in the walled city of Beijing or the various Eight Banner garrisons throughout the empire, the imperial hunt at Mulan became one of the last contexts in which Manchu hunting skills could be practiced, and only by a select few. The institutionalization of the hunt led to its new role as a sort of performance, a stylized homage to past practices that were no longer living traditions for most Manchus. Hence, Elliott has referred to the Qing hunting tradition as an invented tradition, an \\"adaptation of an older practice for newer purposes\\". This adaptation emphasized what Qing emperors considered most important in Manchu culture as they saw it, namely their supposed embodiment of martial (wu) values, as opposed to the civil (wen) values that they attributed to the Chinese (see wen and wu). The Qianlong Emperor likened himself to Emperor Taizong of Tang, who represented a balance of wen and wu. Yet despite presenting themselves as the head of a family encompassing both Chinese and Inner Asian traditions, Qing emperors constantly worried about Manchu acculturation and the adoption of Chinese ways. Part of the imperial hunt's new significance was its perceived value as a form of military training. A Qing dictionary defined the aba hunt as a way of \\"training for military proficiency\\". Theoretically, all Manchus were part of the hereditary warrior caste of the Eight Banners, a military organization which expanded rapidly to include Mongol and Han Chinese contingents during the Qing conquest of the Ming. Military skill, hunting, and Manchu ethnic identity were deeply intertwined. As John Bell wrote, Kangxi saw the hunt as a way to prevent the Manchus from acquiring the perceived Chinese traits of \\"idleness and effeminacy\\". Kangxi's fears had been shared by his grandfather, Hong Taiji, who believed that the Jin dynasty of his Jurchen ancestors had collapsed as a result of entering the \\"Chinese Way\\", to the neglect of their archery and riding skills. The Yongzheng and Qianlong Emperors frequently criticized slipping standards and laziness among the troops of the Eight Banners. Qianlong, unlike Kangxi, Hong Taiji, and Nurhaci, never led military campaigns in person. The annual hunt, as reinstitued under Qianlong, thus represented the best remaining opportunity he had to personally direct his armies in their military training, as well as to regularly reaffirm old Manchu ways through codified ritual in the face of a rapidly shifting Manchu culture.

Methodology Sadananda reminds that:- :‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§¨‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡•ã ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§Ö‡§ß‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§∏‡§Ç‡§¨‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ú‡§®‡§æ‡§®‡§ø : \\"The preliminary questions of the Vedanta are the determination of the competency of the student, the subject-matter, its connection with the book and the necessity of for its study.\\" ‚Äì Vedantasara (sutra I.5) a)- AdhikƒÅra is the capacity to study (adhyana) the subject-matter in which respect there exist doubts (sandigdhata) which is the basis of the intended inquiry into that particular subject-matter for the eventual removal of all doubts and gain of its proper understanding. Madhavacharya speaks about three levels of adhikƒÅra ‚Äì adhama ('lower'), madhyma ('middle') and uttama ('higher'), the last two levels indicate that the student is of peaceful mind (≈õanta), is understanding and has non-repressed sense-control (danta), has withdrawn from worldly objects (uparata), indifferent (titik≈õu) and composed and tranquil (samhita), and knows that he is adequately prepared to meet the truth face to face. The MimƒÅmsikas consider adhikƒÅra to be a notion of appropriateness. All things and actions have identifiable adhikƒÅra. AdhikƒÅra indicates the level of preparation necessary for making one skilled for higher gains. The concept of adhikƒÅra also helps describe the relationship between purusha and prakrti and explain the reason for activation of creative power of nature, and thus brings about the experience of the world (dar≈õana bhoga) and liberation from this experience (kaivalya). The eagerness to know incites the obligation (adhikƒÅra) to bring about realization of knowledge. In this direction the student must firstly develop EkƒÅgratƒÅ ('one-pointed'). Ekagrata is the state of determined and continuous concentration obtained by integrating the psycho-mental flux (sarvƒÅrthatƒÅ i.e. variously directed, discontinuous, diffused attention) which is ‚Äì ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ã‡§ß‡§É (Yoga Sutra)- meaning ‚Äì Yoga is suppression of psycho-mental states i.e. disappearance of all possible misconceptions. In this yogic state of ekagrata the yogi gains genuine will. Upasana brings about ekagrata, and upasana in its own turn is brought about by chitta shuddhi ('the purity of heart'); and controls vikshepa (all forms of mental wanderings or distractions). In Sanskrit grammar, an adhikara is a 'heading rule' made belonging to it, by the accent of swarita with the object of avoiding a repeated designation. b)- Vishaya is the object of knowledge, here the subject-matter; the universal Self (Brahman) seemingly different from the individual self (Jiva). Knowledge reveals the real to be superimposed by the unreal on account of ignorance. As explained by Sadananda the subject is the one-ness of the individual soul and the universal soul (the Absolute) as explained by the Upanishads; this is the essence of the Vedanta. Consciousness, which is infinite and indivisible, is able to come into contact with objects and is inherent in objects which are thus very many varying phases of consciousness; such objects that are by themselves phases of consciousness are vishaya-caitanya, outside consciousness no object can exist. c)- Prayojana means - the 'purpose', 'end result' or 'resolution of the inquiry'; it is the established result arrived at after practice of devotion conducted with a peaceful mind and body (≈õanta bhƒÅva). Uddyotakara explains that the basic urges for attainment of happiness and avoidance of sorrow, such as the chaturvarga composed of dharma, artha, kama and moksha, prompt human activity, and which motivation leads to the end results or prayojana. VedƒÅnta ParibhƒÅ≈õa, recognizing this chaturvarga describes prayojana as that which when known is desired as one's own, Prayojana is the realizable purpose, the desired reason or motive which prompts actions but which cannot be indicated separately from sambandha, both being inter-related, d)- Sambandha does not necessarily identify either vishaya or prayojana though it can be factual and reasonable (siddha) or contrary to fact and reason (asiddha). Shankara tells us that the self is bodyless (a≈õarira) but its relationship (sambandha) with the body is asiddha because the self is unrelated to any activity of the body and unconnected with merit and demerit arising from activity notwithstanding the fact that the jiva erroneously identifies itself with the body. Vedantasara afore-cited statement as an exposition of these four anubandhas ('connections') and in particular the connection called sambandha to mean ‚Äì (quote) \\"the relation of what has to be made known in the Vedantic system, the identity between Brahman and the individual soul\\" (unquote). Implication In Hindu philosophy, Anubandha chatushtaya is a traditional Indian rhetorical mode connected with the gain of knowledge and supreme perfection, which mode is based on four fundamental aspects of thoughts and actions working in-tandem which are ‚Äì a) the proposed subject or theme, b) the intended goal and its nature, c) why for that goal is sought in the light of d) the subject opted and the anticipated apprehension of truth. Krishna assures Arjuna:- :‡§™‡§∞‡§Ç ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§Ø‡§É ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§µ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§Æ‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§Æ‡§Æ‡•ç :‡§Ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§®‡§Ø‡§É ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡•á ‡§™‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§ø‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ã ‡§ó‡§§‡§æ‡§É |: \\"I shall again speak of that highest knowledge which is superior to any other knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained the supreme perfection.\\" Bhagavad Gita (XIV.1) and thereafter, proceeds to explain how that knowledge can be gained and developed which would eventually free a mumukshu ('seeker') who due to association with the modes of nature (prakrti) is entangled in this material world, and therefore, explains the nature of the three gunas. This particular statement is in the form of an Anubandha chatushtaya the subject-matter of which is Brahma Vidya, the goal is liberation from sorrow, and pryojanam is the knowledge of Brahman which gives spontaneous release. Krishna leads Arjuna to that knowledge of the self which reveals what the subject is, what the \\"I\\" is ‚Äì Tat Tvam Asi , this is the relationship that helps the seeker, possessing basic qualities, to decide whether he should connect or associate with the subject-matter or not.

Jordan, 13 U.S. (9 Cranch) 199 (1815), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that someone who had copied a patented invention after the patent had expired, and before the patent was restored by a private bill, would be liable for damages for patent infringement for any use continuing after the patent was restored. It was the second published Supreme Court decision on patent law,Malla Pollack, The Owned Public Domain: The Constitutional Right Not to Be Excluded - or the Supreme Court Chose the Right Breakfast Cereal in Kellogg v. National Biscuit Co., 22 Hastings Comm. & Ent L.J. 265, 291 n119 (2000). and the first of four Supreme Court cases dealing with the Oliver Evans flour mill patent. Like other Supreme Court patent cases prior to Evans v. Eaton, however, this case did not deal with substantive patent law,Harold C. Wegner, Post-Merck Experimental Use and the \\"Safe Harbor\\", 15 Fed. Circuit B.J. 1, 37 (2005). but only with issues of statutory construction and infringement liability. Background Evans' automated flour mill. In the 1780s, prolific inventor Oliver Evans developed a system for an automated flour mill that would revolutionize milling technology. Initially keeping his invention a secret, he obtained protection for it through individual state statutes, for example in Maryland and New Hampshire, because the federal patent system did not yet exist. When the Patent Act of 1790 took effect, Evans obtained the third United States patent ever issued. No copies of the patent are extant today. As all patents at the time had 14-year terms, Evans' patent lapsed in 1804, and the invention entered the public domain. Immediately upon the expiration of his patent, he sought a federal private bill that would allow him to renew it, the first such request ever made. He was unsuccessful until 1808, when the Tenth Congress passed a law authorizing the Secretary of State to grant him a new patent on the same terms as the original one.\\"An Act for the Relief of Oliver Evans\\", 6 Stat. 70. Crucially for this case, however, the law contained a proviso to protect those who had used the invention since the original patent expired: > provided [...] that no person who shall have used the said improvements, or > have erected the same for use before the issuing of said patent shall be > liable for damages therefor.13 U.S. at 200. Evans obtained his new patent on January 22, 1808, the day after the law took effect.Evans v. Jordan, 8 F. Cas. 872, 872 (C.C.D. Va. 1813). But in the intervening years, the defendants Jordan and Morehead had constructed a mill using Evans' invention. Evans sued Jordan and Morehead for patent infringement in the District Court of Virginia in 1810, seeking treble damages under the Patent Act amendments of 1800. Jordan and Morehead defended on the basis that they had constructed the mill while the patent was expired, and the proviso to the 1808 law specifically excluded damages for using or building the invention while the patent was expired. Therefore, the defendants urged, they should not be liable even for the continued use of the mill, since (1) such a reading would vitiate the purpose of the statute's exemption for use between 1804 and 1808, since it would effectively penalize them for having built the invention during that period, and (2) such legislation would be an unconstitutional taking, because it would effectively deprive them of the use of their lawfully constructed mill. The circuit court was divided. Justice Marshall as circuit judge authored an opinion in favor of Evans, reasoning that the language of the statute was plain on its face: it exempted only damages for use or construction of the invention that occurred while the patent was expired, and did not give any exemption for continuing use after the patent was renewed. In particular, Marshall observed that \\"the act for the relief of Oliver Evans, considered independent of any former patent, would authorize him to sustain an action for the use of his invention, after the date of his patent, although the machinery itself had been constructed before its date.\\" Evans v. Jordan, 8 F. Cas. 872, 874 (C.C.D. Va. 1813) aff'd, 13 U.S. 199, 3 L. Ed. 704 (1815). However, the district judge Tucker did not agree with Marshall's reasoning. Therefore, the case went to the Supreme Court on a certificate of division. Opinion of the Court The Court, minus Justice Todd who was absent, unanimously affirmed Justice Marshall's judgment in the district court. The opinion was authored by Justice Washington. The court held, first, that the statute plainly did not exempt infringers from damages for a continuing infringement after the patent was renewed,13 U.S. at 202. and second, that any hardship caused by this result could not justify construing the statute in a way that would be at odds with its plain meaning.13 U.S. at 203. The opinion followed an emerging principle in the judicial decisions of the time on statutory construction: that a statute should never be construed in such a way as to thwart the legislature's policy intent.William N. Eskridge, Jr., All About Words: Early Understandings of the \\"Judicial Power\\" in Statutory Interpretation, 1776-1806, 101 Colum. L.

Incumbents *Premier: Choe Yong-rim (until 1 April), Pak Pong-ju (starting 1 April) *Supreme Leader: Kim Jong-un  Events   January  * January 1 ‚Äì North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un makes a rare New Year broadcast, calling for an improved economy and a reunified Korea. * January 22 ‚Äì The United Nations Security Council passes Resolution 2087, condemning North Korea's December 2012 rocket launch and expanding economic sanctions against the country. * January 24 ‚Äì North Korean authorities announce a new nuclear weapon and long-range missile test, threatening their publicly manifested arch-enemy, the United States, as their primary target. * January 25 ‚Äì North Korea threatens to take \\"strong physical countermeasures\\" if South Korea co-operates with new United Nations Security Council resolutions against it. * January 29 ‚Äì Google expands its Google Maps map data coverage of North Korea, updating what had been blank in most of that country's satellite images, for its search engine. * January 31 ‚Äì South Korean media reports claim that North Korea has been placed under martial law with another nuclear test considered to be imminent.  February  * February 12 ‚Äì North Korea confirms that it has successfully tested a nuclear device, claiming that it is small enough to be weaponized. The South Korean officials report that an \\"artificial earthquake\\" has occurred in North Korea suggesting that a nuclear test has occurred. The test was widely condemned internationally. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, condemned the test, and called it a \\"clear and grave violation\\" of Security Council resolutions. * February 15 ‚Äì 2013 North Korean nuclear test ** In reaction to North Korea's latest nuclear test the European Union will tighten sanctions against the country in the form of blocking the trade of gold and diamonds, as well as cracking down on financial ties between them. ** North Korea tells China that it is prepared to stage one or even two more nuclear tests this year in an effort to force the United States into diplomatic talks. * February 19 ‚Äì North Korea threatens the \\"final destruction\\" of South Korea during a United Nations conference on disarmament.  March  * March 7 ‚Äì 2013 North Korean nuclear test ** North Korea threatens its enemies with the possibility of a pre-emptive nuclear strike, amplifying its threatening rhetoric. ** The United Nations Security Council approves unanimously new sanctions against North Korea for its recent nuclear test. ** During Foal Eagle, an annual training exercise conducted between South Korea and the United States, North Korea threatened to abandon the Korean Armistice Agreement, arguing the exercises threatened North Korea with nuclear weapons and that the U.S. was unwilling to negotiate a peace treaty to replace the armistice. JoongAng Ilbo reported that American vessels equipped with nuclear weapons were participating in the exercise. The U.S. Department of Defense publicly announced that U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam flown over South Korea were reaffirming the U.S.'s \\"nuclear umbrella\\" for South Korea. * March 8 ‚Äì North Korea ends all peace pacts with South Korea and closes the main Panmunjom border crossing inside the Korean Demilitarized Zone. North Korean generals affirm they are aiming their long range missiles at the U.S. mainland in retaliation for the recently approved U.N. sanctions. B-2 stealth bombers flying over the Korean peninsula on March 28, 2013, North Korea threatened the United States with their readiness to launch a rocket. * March 13 ‚Äì North Korea confirmed it ended the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement, declaring that North Korea \\"is not restrained by the North-South declaration on non-aggression\\" and warned that the next step was an act of \\"merciless\\" military retaliation against its enemies. * March 15 ‚Äì United States Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced that the U.S. will add 14 more Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) missiles, one of the key components of the Ground-based Midcourse (GMD) ballistic missile defense system, at Fort Greely, Alaska, boosting the total number of GBI missiles from 30 back to the 44 planned by the Bush administration. Currently, 30 GBI missiles are based at two sites in the U.S., four at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and 26 at Fort Greely in Alaska. The U.S.'s GMD program uses land-based missiles to intercept incoming ballistic missiles in the midcourse phase of their flight, outside the earth atmosphere. GMD is designed to defend against intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). In contrast, the well-known land- based Patriot system with Patriot PAC-3 missiles or the new land-based Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system (as well as the sea-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system) is designed to defend against theatre ballistic missiles (TBMs) including short-range (SRBM), medium-range (MRBM), and intermediate-range (IRBM) missiles. Admiral James A. Winnefeld, Jr., Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also expressed his concern over the threat of North Korea's KN-08 ICBMs, telling reporters at the Pentagon on March 15 that this ICBM has emerged as a threat \\"a little bit faster than we expected.\\" KN-08 missiles were first displayed on 16-wheel carrier trucks during a 2012 military parade, but there are doubts about their authenticity. In addition, Secretary Hagel said that the U.S. is planning to deploy an additional AN/TPY-2 radar, a part of GMD ballistic missile defense system in Japan. This second radar will provide improved early warning and tracking of any missile launched from North Korea at the U.S. or Japan. A first land-based AN/TPY-2 radar was positioned in northern Japan and has been operational since 2006, a second installation was scheduled to be emplaced in central Japan. * March 16 ‚Äì U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced that Fort Greely in Alaska might have to be expanded to protect the United States from potential threats from Iran and North Korea. * March 20 ‚Äì There was a cyber attack against South Korea which added to tensions. It was later confirmed by the South Korean government that North Korea was behind the attack. * March 26 ‚Äì The U.S. again dispatched B-52 bombers from Guam to overfly South Korean territory as part of the ongoing Foal Eagle exercise. These flights were, according to US Department of Defense sources, routine flights intended to demonstrate America's capability of maintaining a \\"continuous bomber presence\\" in the region. ** Japan was to deploy three Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) destroyers equipped with Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system (Aegis BMD) according to Japanese media. Citing unnamed government officials, Japanese news reports said 2 of the destroyers would depart from Sasebo Naval Base in Nagasaki Prefecture, and head for the East China Sea. One of these ships from Sasebo was confirmed as the JDS Chokai (DDG-176). A third destroyer would deploy from Maizuru, Kyoto Prefecture, and head for the Sea of Japan. These warships could either be Kongo class or Atago class guided-missiles destroyers or both. All three ships are equipped with the RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) Block IA, a missile co-developed by and purchased from the U.S., according to Lt. Choji Yoshida, spokesman for the JMSDF Sasebo district headquarters. Japan also moved Patriot PAC-3 missile batteries to Okinawa to intercept a North Korean missile should any piece of it approach Japanese territory or waters. * March 27 ‚Äì Confirmation of the severing of the hotline between the North and the South‚Äîthe last remaining communication link between the two countries at that time‚Äîwas publicly announced, the same date that the hotline was cut off. According to the Korean Central News Agency, a senior North Korean military official stated: \\"Under the situation where a war may break out any moment, there is no need to keep up North-South military communications\\" prior to the cessation of the communication channel. * March 28 ‚Äì Two U.S. Air Force B-2A Spirit stealth bombers flew roundtrip from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri to the skies over the Korean Peninsula where they unloaded inert munitions on a South Korean bombing range. Flying nonstop with the assistance of in-flight refuelers, Pentagon officials called this mission a clear demonstration of \\"the United States' ability to conduct long range, precision strikes quickly and at will\\". A flight of seven B-1B Lancer bombers was also deployed to Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. * March 28 - The international hotel chain Kempinski announced that it was cancelling plans to open the Ryugyong Hotel. The tallest building in Pyongyang, the hotel has been under construction since 1987, but has never opened. * March 30 ‚Äì North Korea declared a 'state of war' against South Korea. A North Korean statement promised \\"stern physical actions\\" against \\"any provocative act\\". North Korean leader Kim Jong-un declared that rockets were ready to be fired at American bases in the Pacific. This was in response to two nuclear-capable American B-2 stealth bombers flying over the Korean peninsula on March 28. The day before North Korea's declaration, the United States Department of Defense said, \\"The United States is fully capable of defending itself and our allies against a North Korean attack. We are firmly committed to the defense of South Korea and Japan.\\" * March 31 ‚Äì Two U.S. Air Force F-22A Raptor stealth fighters were deployed to Osan Air Base, the main U.S. Air Force base in South Korea, from Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan. The aircraft are on static display at Osan Air Base as part of the Foal Eagle exercise to provide bilateral training for the US and the Republic of Korea military and to provide South Korean senior leaders with an orientation to the aircraft, which are an advanced capability available for the defense of South Korea,\\" Pentagon spokesman George Little said on April 1.  April  Estimated maximum ranges for North Korean missiles * April 2 ‚Äì North Korea said it would restart a nuclear reactor capable of producing plutonium at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center, which was closed after six-party talks in 2007. ** The IT webzine BGR carried an article stating that hacker group Anonymous had started Operation North Korea, calling for 'controversial leader Kim Jong-un [to] resign', 'install free democracy' 'abandon its nuclear ambitions', 'uncensored Internet access', etc. The hackers also proclaimed that if the North Korean government does not accede to their demand, they will wage \\"Cyber War.\\" * April 3 ‚Äì North Korea closed entry to the Kaesong Industrial Region to South Koreans. The South Koreans already there were allowed to leave (most stayed voluntarily to continue working). The Kaesong Industrial Region remaining open had previously been seen as a sign that the crisis was not as serious as the rhetoric suggested. The New York Times reported following the closure that \\"The fate of Kaesong is seen as a crucial test of how far North Korea is willing to take its recent threats against the South. Its continued operation was often seen as a sign that Pyongyang's verbal militancy was not necessarily matched by its actions.\\" Kaesong was briefly closed three times in 2009. ** The Pentagon ordered a U.S. Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) advanced ballistic missile defense battery to be deployed to Guam within the next few weeks. The THAAD missile is designed to intercept the Theatre Ballistic Missile (TBM), and consists of a SRBM, a MRBM, and an IRBM. It intercepts missiles during the descent phase at an altitude higher than the current U.S. Army shorter range Patriot missile, that can intercept a TBM only during the terminal (final) phase of flight. U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer equipped with the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System (Aegis BMD) also was sent to the Western Pacific near the Korean Peninsula, to join another destroyer, , to perform a ballistic missile defense mission in response to growing threats. A third destroyer, , is also available. These ships are capable of carrying RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) Block IA anti- ballistic missiles (ABMs). The latest generation of Standard missile, the RIM-174 Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) or Standard Extended Range Active Missile (Standard ERAM), with its advanced active radar seeker, can also be deployed on these warships. SM-6 is capable of defending against a TBM in their terminal phase of flight at an altitude up to and is now superseding RIM-156 Standard Missile 2 Extended Range (SM-2ER) Block IV as U.S. Navy terminal phase TBM interceptor. The Navy received the SM-6 into service in February 2013. U.S. Department of Defense spokesman George Little denied reports that a Sea-Based X-band radar (SBX radar), a floating radar used to track an adversary's missiles as part of a Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) ballistic missile defense system, was being deployed to the waters off Japan, saying no decisions had been made about what would be done with the radar once at-sea testing in the region was finished. ** The North Korean military said it had \\"ratified\\" a merciless attack against the United States, potentially involving a \\"cutting-edge\\" nuclear strike, and that war could break out \\"today or tomorrow\\". * April 5 ‚Äì Multiple countries, including the United Kingdom, Russia, and Sweden (who provides limited consular services for the United States in North Korea), were warned by North Korea that they should evacuate their embassies by April 10. The UK embassy stated they had no plans to do so. ** South Korea dispatched two guided-missile destroyers equipped with Aegis combat system to watch both sides of the peninsula for a possible North Korean missile launch Yonhap news agency reported, citing Republic of Korea (ROK) Navy official sources. These ships are outfitted with the powerful AN/SPY-1D radar capable of detecting ballistic missiles and accurately tracking their trajectories as soon as North Korea launches them. However they cannot yet intercept the incoming ballistic missiles using their primary air defense weapon consisting of 80 RIM-66 Standard Missile 2 Medium Range (SM-2MR) Block IIIA and IIIB missiles. There are no confirmed reports that South Korea had bought RIM-156 Standard Missile 2 Extended Range (SM-2ER) Block IV missile, the newer version of Standard missile capable of intercepting ballistic missiles during their terminal phase of flight. SM-2ER Block IV has been deployed on U.S. Navy guided-missiles cruisers and destroyers equipped with Aegis combat system for many years. With North Korea prepared for launching missiles and South Korea placing naval destroyers on its coasts, tensions in the Korean peninsula remain at a heightened state. Anticipating the upcoming North Korea's missile test the U.S. set to deploy a RQ-4 Global Hawk Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) surveillance aircraft to Japan to boost surveillance capabilities over North Korea. The Global Hawk will be stationed at Misawa Air Base in northern Japan. The U.S. military informed Japan last month about plans to deploy the plane between June and September but may bring the date forward, it said, following reports about North Korea's preparations for missile launches. * April 6 ‚Äì The Foreign Ministry of Germany stated that their embassy in Pyongyang will continue working, but it will be evaluated regularly for security and exposure. The United Kingdom reassured that they are staying and Sweden and France have also stated that they have no plans for evacuation. However Russia is considering the evacuation of staff due to the tensions. * April 7 ‚Äì The Pentagon announced that the Minuteman III missile test at Vandenberg Air Force Base, which was planned for April 9, would be postponed. The test was not associated with the North Korea crisis, but the United States decided to hold off \\"given recent tensions on the Korean Peninsula,\\" said a Department of Defense official. * April 9 ‚Äì North Korean workers did not report to work at the Kaesong industrial zone. The North Korean Government removed 50,000 workers from the Kaesong industrial park, which effectively shut down all activities. ** North Korea warned all foreign companies and tourists in South Korea to evacuate, stating that the two nations were on the verge of nuclear war. * April 20 ‚Äì North Korea accepted China's offer for dialogue. * April 26 ‚Äì South Korea announced that it would withdraw its remaining workers from the Kaesong Industrial Region to protect their safety after the North Korean government rejects talks. * April 29 ‚Äì All but seven South Korean workers leave the Kaesong Industrial Region. * April 30 ‚Äì The annual Foal Eagle joint military drills between South Korea and the United States came to a close with both nations continuously monitoring the situation on the Korean peninsula.  May  * May 1 ‚Äì North Korea's Supreme Court sentenced Kenneth Bae to 15 years hard labor for \\"committing hostile acts\\". North Korea provided no evidence against Bae but it was reported by multiple news organisations that he had taken pictures of starving North Korean children. * May 3 ‚Äì The remaining seven South Korean workers at Kaesong Industrial Region left. The Kaesong Industrial Complex, the last symbol of inter-Korean relations, was shut down. North Korea stated that South Korea was fully culpable for the shutdown, and claimed that any finished products left at the Kaesong Complex would belong to the North. * May 15 ‚Äì The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, and China Construction Bank, three of the Big Four banks of China, halted all financial transactions between China and North Korea.Simon Rabinovitch, China banks rein in support for North Korea , Financial Times (May 13, 2013). The fourth Big Four bank, the Bank of China, had taken the same step several days before.Keith Bradsher and Nick Cumming-Bruce, China Cuts Ties With Key North Korean Bank , New York Times (May 7, 2013). * May 18 ‚Äì North Korea launched three short-range guided missiles into the Sea of Japan. The first two missiles were shot in the morning, while the third was in the afternoon. The missiles were launched from the same location where two missiles had been displayed, fueled, and then removed weeks before. * May 19 ‚Äì North Korea launched a fourth rocket that landed in the Sea of Japan. ** Jiang Yaxian, Chinese counselor to North Korea, told the state news agency Xinhua that North Korea had seized a Dalian-based private vessel in waters between China and the Korean peninsula on the evening of May 5. The owner of the ship, Yu Xuejun, and Chinese authorities are seeking the boat's release. Chinese state media reported that North Korea is demanding 600,000 yuan (US$97,600) for the safe return of the ship and its crew of 16.Adam Jourdan, China seeks release of fishing boat seized by North Korea (May 19, 2013), Reuters. * May 20 ‚Äì North Korea launched short-range projectiles that landed in waters off the country's eastern coast. ** After Chinese protests, North Korea releases 16 fishermen after demanding a ransom.

It would be his only senior appearance until the 1935 season, when Lamb played for Geelong while at the centre of a dispute between the club and the Geelong branch of the Waterside Workers' Federation. The branch alleged that Lamb had worked as a volunteer during the meat strikes and as a result declared the Geelong Football Club as \\"black\\", for as long as Lamb remained on the club's list. The opening round fixture against Carlton, which Lamb played in, was almost abandoned. Five players reportedly asked for Lamb to be omitted, out of fear of the consequences of having him take the field. This prompted the club president to make an appeal, saying that Lamb would play as he had the support of the committee, and that anyone who pulled out of the game wouldn't play for Geelong again or be cleared to another league club. Lamb also appeared for Geelong in rounds two and three, then lost his place in the side. He was omitted from Geelong's list in 1936, it is unclear whether that was as a result of the pressure put on the club. Lamb continued his career at Newtown & Chilwell.

It was designed by Andrea Stombuco and built from 1886 to 1887. It is also known as Palmerosa, Palmarosa, and Sans Souci. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Palma Rosa is a three-level sandstone house built in 1886-87, possibly as a speculative venture for, and to the design of, prominent Brisbane architect Andrea Stombuco. It is one of Stombuco's most flamboyant residential designs, erected at the pinnacle of his success in Queensland. Ironically, construction of the building may also have been a strong contributory cause to his near insolvency in the late 1880s/early 1890s. Andrea Stombuco was an Italian sculptor and builder who had travelled widely and was involved in various business enterprises, including stone quarrying at Cape Town in South Africa, before emigrating to Victoria in 1851. After trying his luck on the goldfields, he established himself in Victoria as a sculptor, monumental mason, builder and architect, and found a patron in the Roman Catholic Church. He was the contractor for a number of Catholic churches in Victoria and for most of the stonework of Ballarat Cathedral, and in 1869 was appointed Architect for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Goulburn in New South Wales. Stombuco moved to Queensland in 1875 on the advice of Rev. Patrick Dunne of Goulburn, and may have been appointed Catholic Diocesan Architect, receiving a number of important architectural commissions from the Roman Catholic Bishop of Brisbane, James O'Quinn. These included St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace at Brisbane (1875‚Äì76), St Mary's Presbytery at Ipswich (1876), St Francis Xavier Church at Goodna (1880‚Äì81), part of All Hallows at Petrie Bight (1880‚Äì82) and St Patrick's Church at Fortitude Valley (1880‚Äì82). With his eldest son, Giovanni Stombuco, whom he took into partnership in 1886, he also designed St Joseph's Christian Brother's College at Nudgee, erected 1889-90. Among his more prominent non-Catholic works were St Andrew's Anglican Church at South Brisbane (1878‚Äì83) and Her Majesty's Opera House in Queen Street (1885‚Äì88). Stombuco designed a number of large houses in Brisbane, including Friedenthal (1886‚Äì87) at Eagle Farm for WH Heckelman; and Rhyndarra (1889) at Yeronga for W Williams. He also designed several speculative ventures for himself, including Bertholme at New Farm (now the Moreton Club). When Queensland's boom economy crashed in 1890, Stombuco was forced to auction his then residence, Briar House - a more modest residence in Lechmere Street, New Farm, which he had erected in 1888 - and left Queensland for Perth, Western Australia in 1891. His wife and son remained in Queensland, but Stombuco never returned, and died in Perth in 1907. Giovanni Stombuco retired from architecture when his father left Queensland in 1891, moving with his mother to Spring Vale Farm at Kuraby. Whether Palma Rosa (originally named Sans Souci -'without care') was built as a speculative venture, or whether it was intended as the Stombuco family home, is not clear. If the Stombucos occupied the house, it was very briefly. The house was completed by mid-December 1887, when Stombuco hosted an entertainment at Sans Souci to mark the completion of the building, but from 1888 to 1891, when he left the colony, the Queensland Post Office Directories list Stombuco's private residence as Lechmere Street, New Farm. Stombuco had obtained title to the Sans Souci site in 1886. At that time it comprised , and was part of the Toorak Estate subdivision. The house was designed in 1886, the year Giovanni Stombuco entered into partnership with his father, but it is not known to what extent he contributed to the design. The house was constructed in 1886-87 by Brisbane contractors JAM O'Keeffe (who possibly had the overall supervision), A Petrie (who supplied the stone) and J Watson (presumably of the plumbing firm Watson Brothers), and builders Bell & McLaughlan. On completion in late 1887, Sans Souci was described in the local press as undoubtedly one of the finest residences in or about Brisbane. The building was of three storeys, and constructed of stone from Petrie's Quarry (probably the nearby Petrie's Quarry, on the northern side of Crosby Road). The rooms were all generously proportioned, with elaborate French-polished joinery and highly decorative cornices and ceiling roses in the principal rooms. The main hallway was decorated with an arch supported by fluted columns with corinthian capitals, and had tessellated Minton tiles on the floor. Sicilian marble was used for the steps at the front door and at the porch entrance, and for most of the mantelpieces, which also had Minton tiles in the hearths. Original plans indicate that the sub-floor contained a generous L-shaped dining room, kitchen, scullery, pantry and servant's room; the piano nobile contained a drawing room and library (connected by folding doors) over the dining room, a boudoir and two bedrooms on the east side of the hall, and a main staircase off the vestibule to the west; and the upper floor accommodated 5 bedrooms and a bathroom. The three floor plans virtually replicated each other, and included a generous hall, wide, running centrally north-south on each level. Initially, verandahs across the whole of the southern and western elevations were intended, but only sections of these appear to have been built. In September 1888, Stombuco took out a mortgage of on Sans Souci from the Queensland Investment and Land Mortgage Company Ltd, of which Sir Arthur Hunter Palmer, Premier of Queensland from May 1870 to January 1874, was a director and principal shareholder. Even before Stombuco left Queensland in 1891, it appears that the mortgage company controlled the property, although Stombuco technically retained title until 1913. The house was clearly a rental property by 1890, at which time it was known as Palmerosa, and was occupied briefly (-90) by prominent Brisbane jeweller Lewis Flegeltaub, who had moved to Newstead House by 1891. Through the 1890s and early 1900s, Palmarosa was home to a number of socially prominent people and their families, including Joseph Bennett (possibly a Fassifern grazier) 1892-93; Reginald E Finlay (manager of the Queensland Investment and Land Mortgage Company Ltd) -97; Captain TM Almond (Queensland portmaster 1890-1902) in the late 1890s; and William Hood, MLA, in the early 1900s. From to , the principal occupant was Arthur Cecil Hunter Palmer, a civil engineer and second son of Sir Arthur Hunter Palmer. ACH (Cecil) Palmer and his wife, Lorna Barron, appear to have settled at Palmarosa within a year or so of their marriage in August 1902, and in 1913 title to the property was transferred to Mr Palmer. The Palmers were well known in Brisbane society for their race-day verandah parties at Palmarosa, overlooking the Albion Park Raceway, with \\"bookies\\" said to have visited the house to take bets. By 1932 the house had been divided into three flats, with the Palmers occupying the top floor. During the Second World War, Palmarosa was occupied by United States military personnel from 1942 to . Back view of Palma Rosa The house remained in the Palmer family until title passed in 1945 to Charles Robinson, then to Charles Lawrence Hayles in 1946. In 1951 the residence was converted to a boarding house - several of its residents later became prominent, including Sir William Knox and several judges - and Hayles subdivided the property in 1954. Title to the house block was transferred a number of times in the 1950s, and in the late 1950s or early 1960s the place was converted to a private convalescence hospital. By September 1963 the verandahs had been removed and additional toilets installed for hospital use. Also by this date, the name Palma Rosa was being spelt as two words. In 1972 the property, on a reduced site of just over was bought at auction by Ralph Holden on behalf of the English Speaking Union (ESU), a Queensland branch of which he had established in Brisbane in 1968. The ESU, based in London, is an educational, cultural and social society advocating English as an international means of communication. There are a number of branches of the ESU in Australia and in many other nations, but few own property. Since 1972 Palma Rosa has functioned as club rooms and art gallery for the ESU's Queensland branch. In 1975 a new deed of grant was issued to The English Speaking Union (Queensland Branch), in which the Hamilton land was granted to the Union and its successors Upon Trust for Buildings (Preservation of Historic Heritage) purposes. In the early 1980s the Union installed a resident caretaker at Palma Rosa, a role which later was taken by the president of the English Speaking Union in Queensland, Patricia Johnson, and her family. Repair works for the ESU were undertaken at Palma Rosa between 1972 and the mid-1980s, including reconstruction of the verandahs, and in 1996-97 the Union commissioned a substantial conservation report on the building. By 2010, the ESU sold the property at auction for $3.715 million to a local family who planned to restore the property. The auction was hampered by disruptive actions by some members of the ESU who objected to the sale. In July 2010, the ESU purchased another heritage-listed property at Cook Terrace in Milton.  Description  Palma Rosa is located on a hillside block at Hamilton overlooking the Albion Park Racecourse and Breakfast Creek. From the racecourse, the house is the most prominent building in the landscape, and possesses considerable landmark value. Palma Rosa is a large sandstone residence arranged on three levels (two storeys and a full sub-floor) and has an attached 5 level tower, from the upper level of which there are fine vistas of the Bulimba and Hamilton Reaches of the Brisbane River. The windows on the fourth level of the tower have been filled in. The building has a hipped roof, the outer faces of which are clad with slate tiles and the inner with \\"panel deck\\". There are double-storeyed, early 1980s, reconstructed verandahs across the northern (front) and eastern elevations, returning around the southern (rear) elevation to end at a tower. On the western elevation the original verandahs have been enclosed to provide toilets/bathrooms. There is a 3-level, projecting faceted bay, on both the southern and western sides of the building. These take advantage of the vistas over the racecourse to Breakfast Creek and the Brisbane River beyond. The front of the building addresses Queens Road to the north. The principal entrance is via a flight of centrally- positioned front steps leading to the piano nobile. Internally the house comprises 15 main rooms on 3 levels, with a wide vestibule/hallway running centrally north-south through the house on each level. The floor plans of all 3 levels are almost identical. The principal rooms on the ground and first floor are over in height and have decorative plaster cornices which are perforated or undercut, and perforated ceiling roses (these appear to have been designed to ventilate to the roof or floor cavity above). There is extensive use of cedar joinery throughout, including panelled reveals and carved transoms to the doorways. The hallway on the principal level has tessellated tiles on the floor and corinthian pilasters to the archway separating hall from vestibule. There are 8 fireplaces with marble surrounds and tiles to the hearths, as well as the kitchen flue. The house occupies most of the block, with a few trees and shrubs along the side boundaries and a small lawn at the rear. There is little original planting. Across the front of the property is a masonry and cast-iron fence.

The battalion traces its lineage to 1812, and it is currently assigned to the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division. The battalion has served in the Seminole Wars, the Civil War, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, World War I, World War II, Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation Enduring Freedom. History The history of the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment dates back to January 11, 1812, when the first GUNNERS assembled near Salisbury, North Carolina, as Capt. Donoho's Company, the 2nd Regiment of Artillery. Units of the regiment were involved in their first combat during the War of 1812 in the Canadian Campaign. The battalion has since earned numerous battle streamers including one for fighting against the Seminoles during the Indian Wars in Florida. Units of the regiment were awarded 13 battle streamers for service during the Mexican War. This included battles fought at Vera Cruz and Cerro Gordo. Less than 15 years later, the battalion earned 14 battle streamers participating in the American Civil War including campaigns at Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, the Wilderness and Petersburg. In 1898, the battalion participated in the Santiago Campaign of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In July 1918, the unit deployed to Europe with the 6th Division for action in WWI. In August 1944, the battalion returned to action in Europe as part of the 9th Armored Division, spending time in Britain and France. The battalion soon engaged the Germans along the Siegfried Line on Germany's western border. During the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and January 1945, the battalion helped relieve the garrison at Bastogne, and they later supported the drive into Germany across the Rhine River at Remagen. It smashed its way through central Germany near Wetzlar before driving northward toward Berlin and then south into Czechoslovakia before taking up occupation duty near Nurnberg. During that time in action, about eight months, the battalion earned its laurels as the unit that saw the most time in combat of any unit in the 9th Armored Division. Firing 56,426 rounds from its M7 \\"Priest\\" self-propelled 105-mm howitzers, the battalion earned the most individual decorations of any unit in the division artillery. The battalion even earned the Presidential Unit Citation for its actions taken at the onset of the \\"Battle of the Bulge.\\" 2-3 Pic 2 On February 24, 1991, the battalion moved across the Iraqi border in support of Operation Desert Storm and fired their first round at the enemy since 1945. In 2004, the battalion deployed with the 1st Brigade Combat Team (Ready First), 1 Armored Division in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom to Baghdad and again in 2006 to Tal Afar and Ramadi. The battalion deactivated in 2007 in Giessen, Germany, and reactivated in 2008 as part of the Ready First Combat Team at Fort Bliss. 2-3 FA deployed to Shah Wali Kot District, Kandahar, Afghanistan, from December 2012 to September 2013 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom as a combined arms task force as well as provided artillery support throughout the Ready First area of operations. http://www.bliss.army.mil/1BCT1ARM/2-3.html Lineage & Honors Lineage * Constituted 11 January 1812 in the Regular Army as a company in the 2d Regiment of Artillery * Organized in July 1812 near Salisbury, North Carolina, as Captain Sanders Donoho's Company, 2d Regiment of Artillery * Consolidated in December 1812 with Captain William A.

The audio released on 8 April 2015, and the film released on 14 May 2015. The film received mixed reviews upon its release. It is loosely based on the 1990 film Total Recall. Synopsis The story starts at a hospital in Mumbai, where Bose (Nandamuri Balakrishna) has come out of a coma after 18 months. As soon as he recovers, Bose is identified as Godse by everyone around him. He is surprised when an elderly couple, Bhoopathi (Chandra Mohan) and Malathi Devi (Jayasudha), claim to be his parents. Bose tries to convince everyone that he is not Godse and that he has his own story. Soon, he comes to Hyderabad in search of his true identity and bumps into Mahalakshmi (Trisha), who he believes is his lover. When she tells him that it is a case of mistaken identity, Godse is taken aback. He meets a similar fate when he meets his parents (Chalapathi Rao & Geetha). Suddenly, a girl named Sarayu (Radhika Apte) arrives as Godse's wife and tries to remind him of their married life, which creates a lot of confusion. Later, Godse finds out that it was all a ruse set up by Bharadwaja (Prakash Raj), Chief Minister of the state. It is also revealed that his real name is Bose. It is later disclosed that Bose is a sincere and powerful CBI officer on a mission to crack the suspicious death of former Chief Minister of State, Achyuta Ramayya (Vijayakumar). Bose learns that an influential person, sitting CM Bharadwaj, is behind the death of the former CM. Bose tries to prove him guilty. The rest of this movie deals with why the CM wanted Bose alive and why he set him up with a new identity.

Canada first established a Customs office in Osoyoos in 1861. Today it is a busy 24-hour crossing that features a large joint border station that houses both the US and Canada border inspection services. History The original Canada border inspection station was situated near the north end of Osoyoos lake in 1861. This location was not very effective, so the building was physically moved into the village of Osoyoos in 1865. The building burned down in 1878, so the Customs officer operated out of his home until his death in 1888. A border station was constructed at the US border in the early 1900s, and was rebuilt around 1930. Finally a brick facility was built around 1952 which remained in use until the joint border station was built in 2003. The US operated a Customs office in the village of Oroville until 1933, when it built an inspection station and officer housing at the border. This building remained in use until the joint border station was completed in 2003.

The Imperial Japanese Army's area armies had responsibility for raising and administering Boeitai units, and there was considerable variation in how these formations were structured and used.Nichols and Shaw (1955), p. 53 Boeitai units were established in the Japanese home islands, Okinawa, Korea and Formosa.Hayashi (2005), p. 52 Unlike regular Japanese Army soldiers, Boeitai personnel were not indoctrinated to fight to the death or consider themselves to be imperial subjects. Around 20,000 local Boeitai conscripts were involved in the Battle of Okinawa during 1945, with most initially serving as labourers or in support roles but some augmenting frontline Army units. Most of the Okinawan Boeitai were teenagers or aged in their 30s and 40s. As the fighting continued, many of the support personnel were assigned to combat duties despite not being provided with any training for this role or effective weapons; some Boeitai personnel were ordered to conduct suicide missions in which they attempted to blow up tanks with satchel charges. In addition, several Okinawan Boeitai groups fought as partisans armed mainly with spears and grenades.Nichols and Shaw (1955), p. 110 Morale among Boeitai personnel in Okinawa was low, due to the discrimination they suffered at the hands of Japanese military personnel and a widespread belief that the war was lost. In addition, many Boeitai conscripts had families to support. As a result, around 20 percent of Boeitai personnel on Okinawa deserted or surrendered to American forces. However, 50 percent of the personnel became casualties during the battle.Hayashi (2005), pp. 53-54 See also *Himeyuri Students *Volunteer Fighting Corps References ;Citations ;Works consulted  Category:Imperial Japanese Army Category:1944 establishments in Japan Category:Military units and formations established in 1944 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1945 Category:Paramilitary organizations based in Japan Category:Japan campaign ","title":"Boeitai"},{"id":"44911561","text":"WRKD-LP is a Variety Hits formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Rockford, Ohio and serving Rockford, Mendon, and Ohio City in Ohio.

Kangavarma was a ruler of the Kadamba Dynasty of India. He ruled from c.360/5 until c. 385/90. Talagunda inscription indicates that his rule was a turbulent one with many bitter wars. He was succeeded by Bhagiratha. Legacy Mayurasharma (345 to 360AD), who founded his dream empire, the Kadamba empire, on a well-established footing, left it to his son Kangavarma, who had to wage many costly wars. As the wars he waged were always not fruitful, they got the epithet \\"terrible wars\\". According to Talagunda inscriptions the period of the reign of Kangavarma was between 360 and 385 AD. According to Prof. Jouveau-Dubreuil, Prithivisena I of the kingdom of Vakasaka defeated Kangavarma. In spite of this defeat, Kangavarma was able to establish himself as an independent ruler commanding allegiance from the feudal leaders of the districts in his kingdom. According to Talagunda records he was considered a very popular king of the Kadamba country. His son, Bhagiratha, succeeded him and reigned up to 420 AD, and he was successful in regaining the territory which his father had lost in the war. His reign has been described as one of the finest of the Kadamba dynasty. Kadamba dynasty The Kadamba dynasty, though popular in the history of the Dekkan, did not receive its due share in history books but the rulers who succeeded Mayurasharma who established the kingdom, were very successful in furthering the cause of their dynasty, till they lost their control to the Chalukyas of Badami around the seventh century. Mythical origin is attributed to the first ruler Mayaurasharma of the Kadamba dynasty, though he in fact was a historical figure. It is established that the authenticity of the name \\"Kadamba\\" is attributed to the Kadamba tree which was in the courtyard of their residence when the kingdom was first established.

It is the centrepiece of Mill Lake Park. History Mill Lake was originally known as Bais Lake, after a pioneer farmer, before being renamed Abbotsford Lake, due to its location. It was renamed Mill Lake because of its role in local forestry. Around the turn of the nineteenth century, Abbotsford resident Charles Hill-Tout opened a sawmill on the shores of Mill Lake, and it contributed over 50,000 railway ties to the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1903, brothers Joe, Richard Arthur, Sam and Bill Trethewey purchased the mill, and in 1912 opened the Abbotsford Timber and Trading Company. This company swiftly became one of the highest employers in all of British Columbia, producing 20 million feet of timber boards per year. The lake was used to sort the logs that arrived by rail, where they were processed and sent to primarily American markets. The mill remained active until 1934, when the Great Depression and the depletion of local forests forced the brothers to close the site. The Abbotsford Lions Club purchased the site, removed the mill equipment, and began the process of turning Mill Lake into a park, bringing in sand and grass locations for visitors. Geography Mill Lake is located in central Abbotsford, bordered to the south by Bevan Avenue, to the east by Ware Street, to the north by Mill Lake Road and Bourquin Crescent, and to the west by Emerson Street and Gladwin Road.

Date and photographer unknown. Margaret Tomkins (1916‚Äì2002) was an American Surrealist / Abstract Expressionist painter. Though born, raised, and educated in Southern California, she spent most of her life in the Pacific Northwest, where she was well known both for her art and her energetic, outspoken art activism. Her Surrealist works of the 1940s earned considerable national attention, and as her work evolved in the 1950s and 1960s, she came to be known as a pioneer in Abstract Expressionism. Tomkins was the driving force behind the first artist-owned gallery in Seattle, Washington. Though friends with many of the artists of the Northwest School, she denied any artistic connection to these \\"mystic\\" painters, at times deriding their claims of quasi-magical inspiration from nature as \\"silly\\". She was similarly dismissive of any categorization based on her gender. She was married to painter and sculptor James FitzGerald, who died in 1973. She spent most of the last thirty years of her life living in a rustic home-studio in the San Juan Islands. She continued painting until a few days before her death, maintaining a distinctive abstract style in various phases. Life and career Tomkins was born on September 11, 1916, in Los Angeles, California, to Percival James and Margaret Quinn Tomkins. She had an older brother named Jack. Her father was in the paint manufacturing business and her mother was a gifted musician. After completing high school she attended the University of Southern California and, during summers, the Chouinard Art Institute. A memorable experience for the young artist was seeing Pablo Picasso's Guernica at the Stendahl Gallery in Los Angeles. She was an officer of the California Watercolor Society, but painted in oil as well. Her work was first seen nationally at the 1939 New York World's Fair's American Art Today exhibit, where she displayed a Regionalist-style landscape in watercolor. Tomkins relocated to Seattle, Washington, in 1939, becoming an Assistant Professor of Art at the University of Washington for a brief period. In 1940, she married Seattle artist James H. FitzGerald (1910‚Äì1973) who would also become a leading painter and sculptor in the Northwest. In 1941, she had her first solo exhibition at the Seattle Art Museum. The same year, Tomkins became involved in the Federal Art Project, teaching at the Spokane Art Center, one of the leading WPA facilities in the country, after her husband was appointed director of the center by Washington FAP head Bruce Inverarity. In 1942 Tomkins and Fitzgerald returned to Seattle, moving back into a house in the Capitol Hill neighborhood which they had purchased and begun renovating in 1939. Night Bondage, Margaret Tomkins, 1945. During the Second World War, while FitzGerald worked at Boeing, Tomkins gave birth to the first of their three children. She supplemented their income with ceramic works, and began working with egg tempera while sketching out new directions for her painting. In addition to painting, Tomkins and FitzGerald were both fine craftsmen and sculptors, working in ceramics and even furniture design. Their Modernist ceramics were mostly utilitarian objects such as bowls, vessels and lamps, done in a unique and imaginative style. Works by Tomkins appeared in several annual shows at the Whitney in New York and the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., and in 1947 three of her pieces were selected for inclusion in the Abstract and Surrealist American Art exhibit at the Chicago Art Institute. That same year, a one-person show of twenty-three of her paintings was mounted at the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco alongside a solo exhibition of prints by surrealist artist Roderick Mead; these works were also shown at the Seattle Art Museum. At this time, with only a handful of small galleries (such as Zoe Dusanne's and Otto Seligman's) showing modern art in Seattle, Tomkins was looking beyond the confines of the Northwest for both inspiration and reaction. Two of Tomkins' submissions for the Northwest Annuals were purchased by SAM in the 1940s, before her anger over the museum's relationship with the group of artists who would become known as the Northwest School led her to boycott the Annuals. Paintings such as Metamorphosis (1943) and Anamorphosis (1944) show how completely she had moved beyond the Regionalism of her California Watercolor Society days. Tomkin's surrealistic biomorphism of the 1940s transferred creative internal energies into organic, visceral abstractions based on natural forms, a direction she continued to explore through the 1950s. The influence of European Surrealists such as Salvador Dali is evident, and - despite her problems with the politics and pretensions of the Northwest School - so is the influence of Morris Graves and other Northwest painters. In 1948 Tomkins and FitzGerald purchased several acres of land on Lopez, in the San Juan Islands, on which the family began constructing a summer home/studio using mostly natural, found, and recycled materials. In 1958, Tomkins became the driving force behind the Artists Gallery, the first gallery in Seattle to be owned by the artists themselves. The co-op of Tomkins, FitzGerald, Louis Bunce, William Ivey, Manuel Izquierdo, and Alden Mason managed to keep the gallery at 1705 E. Olive Way going for about a year. In 1959, a devastating fire at their Capitol Hill studio destroyed the majority of the works Tomkins and FitzGerald had produced up until that time. Tomkins was in California at the time of the fire, tending to her ailing mother, who died three weeks later. In the 1960s Tomkins, having shifted from tempera to oil painting, created the pure Abstract style for which she remains best-known today. Transformation and metamorphosis were common themes, with forms shape-shifting across her canvases, twisting and intertwining with or obscuring each other. She generally used a limited palette of grays, whites, and earth tones, with occasional flashes of red, blue, and yellow, developing an intricate symbolic language to express social and environmental concerns or reflect on personal experiences. She returned to the University of Washington as a guest professor in 1962, and again in 1972. Autumn, Margaret Tomkins, 1963. In 1973 FitzGerald died of bone cancer, and Tomkins took on the job of completing a 6,000-pound, 11-foot-high bronze fountain her husband had been commissioned to build. She saw the piece, called Waterfront Fountain, through to completion and installation at Seattle's Waterfront Park. After FitzGerald's death Tomkins stopped exhibiting her work regularly, but continued painting, developing a more geometric, pastel-toned style. She spent most of the last thirty years of her life at her home on Lopez Island. In 1988 she suffered a stroke, which left her unable to speak. Her last large exhibition was held at Seattle's Foster/White Gallery in 1993. In 2002 her daughter Miro FitzGerald-Watson had her moved to a care facility near Miro and her husband's home in Sedona, Arizona; in March 2002, Margaret Tomkins died at age 85. Legacy Margaret Tomkins' work has been included in exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Art Institute of Chicago; the Corcoran Gallery, Washington, D.C.; the Seattle Art Museum; the Portland Art Museum; the Tacoma Art Museum; the Bellevue Arts Museum; the Henry Art Gallery; the Frye Art Museum; Washington State University; Evergreen State College; the Whatcom Museum; and many other museums and galleries.

It was described in 1810 by Robert Brown. David Morrison in his 1986 paper on Lechenaultia selected Lechenaultia formosa to be the lectotype for the genus. It is in the section lechenaultia in the genus. Its closest relatives (according to a cladogram based on morphological features) appear to be L. chlorantha and L. liniaroides. The plant's generic name honors the French botanist Jean-Baptiste Leschenault de La Tour, a pioneer in Australian botany. Lechenaultia formosa grows as a spreading shrub, anywhere from high. Lechenaultia formosa is found across a wide swathe of Western Australia, from the Geraldton sandplains south through to the southwestern corner of the state and east along the southern coast. It grows on granite-, laterite- or clay soils, where it is found on hills, and in flat areas and gullies. Renowned for its bright red, orange or yellow flowers, Lechenaultia formosa is widely cultivated in Australian gardens. It was first grown in the United Kingdom in 1824. Many cultivars were sold in the 1960s that are no longer available. It grows best in well- ventilated locations with very good drainage; otherwise it is prone to fungal disease, in particular grey mould (Botrytis cinerea) of the branches and soil- borne Phytophthora and Pythium, and is often short-lived. It is propagated readily from cuttings of semi-hardened wood. Plants grown this way can be used to replace older plants when they die. Lechenaultia formosa can be grown in hanging baskets or rockeries.

(The logo indicates that the shop is affiliated with Edeka.) Colonial goods stores are retailers of foods and other consumer goods imported from European colonies, called colonial goods. During the nineteenth century, they formed a distinct category of retailer in much of Europe, specializing in coffee, tea, spices, rice, sugar, cocoa and chocolate, and tobacco. By the mid twentieth century, these stores had become general grocery stores selling a variety of commodities that were easy to store, as contrasted with greengrocers, butchers, bakers, fishmongers, and so on. With the advent of supermarkets, the name \\"colonial stores\\" continued to be used, despite the end of colonialism, for small, independent stores. Such stores existed across Europe. In German, they were called Kolonialwaren 'colonial goods', in French, comptoir des colonies 'colonial store', in Italian, coloniali 'colonials',Mauro Giancaspro, \\"I Coloniali\\", Wall Street International Magazine January 16, 2017 and in Spanish and Portuguese, ultramarinos 'overseas (goods)'. The luxury grocer H√©diard started as a colonial goods store, originally named \\"Comptoir d'√©pices et des colonies\\". In Britain, Home and Colonial Stores became a major retail chain. Decline and legacy Germanic and Nordic countries By the end of the twentieth century, the term had largely fallen out of use, while the items in which colonial goods retailers had specialized had long since been included in the wider range of goods offered by general purpose supermarkets. Where colonial goods shops survived, they were regarded as old fashioned, and tended to be known in Germany and Switzerland as Aunt Emma Shops, that is, \\"mom and pop\\" stores. In Austria the etymologically convoluted term Grei√üler is used. In Germany the earlier term is still used in Bremen by the William Holtorf Colonial Goods Shop, founded in 1874, which claims to be Germany‚Äôs last colonial goods shop. Germany‚Äôs largest (in 2014) supermarket group, Edeka, preserved the word in its full name, Einkaufsgenossenschaft der Kolonialwarenh√§ndler im Halleschen Torbezirk zu Berlin).

Both lakes contribute to Cowichan River. Quamichan Lake's outflow is Quamichan Creek which joins with Somenos Creek, the outflow from Somenos Lake, which flows to Cowichan River. The Cowichan Watershed Board identifies a common set of conditions for both shallow lakes: * excessive nutrient loading from the farms and homes which surround the lakes * insufficient \\"flushing\\" in summer due to reduced inflows and truncated outflows * increased plant growth (\\"algae-blooms\\"), and * eutrophication (reduced oxygen as the vegetation decomposes) * intensified warming In autumn 2016, the lake's algae received public attention after news coverage of its killing at least four dogs.

It generally refers to a region of deeply incised valleys from the Rench valley and southern foothills of the Kniebis in the north to the area of Freiburg im Breisgau and Donaueschingen in the south. Its highest area, which is southeast of the Elz valley, is also part of the High Black Forest.  Geography  The dominating valley system of the Kinzig cuts through the Middle Black Forest from east to west. Prominent peaks are the Kandel (), Wei√ütannenh√∂he (), Obereck (), Rohrhardsberg (), Brend (), St√∂cklewald () and Mooswaldkopf () south of the Kinzig, and the Brandenkopf () and Lettst√§dter H√∂he () north of the Kinzig.  Geology  Gneisses and granites predominate. Unlike the Northern Black Forest the Bunter sandstone covering with its plateau-like mountain shapes has only survived in a few places on the eastern perimeter. Elsewhere the land is marked by narrow ridges and valley floors or, especially in the southeast or even in island-like remnants, hilly highland valley landscapes. The average height of the Central Black Forest is rather lower than in the Northern and Southern Black Forest. Relative heights are, however, similar; steep mountainsides can rise to 700 metres above the valley bottoms (e.g. in the valley of Simonsw√§lder Tal).

Earning a master's degree in 1935 from Ohio State University and a Ph.D. in 1966 from Harvard University, she served as a researcher and historian for over four decades and became one of the first black woman to earn a PhD from Harvard University in history. As a teacher, she started her career in Macon County, Alabama between 1935 and 1936. Later in 1937, she became Tuskegee Institute's instructor in history but left in 1940. Between 1940 and 1945 she worked at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis, Tennessee as a tutor. From 1968 to 1971, she served as a Fulbright lecturer at Monash University and Australia National University followed by a period in 1971 working as a consultant at the Federal Executive Institute. Between 1971 and 1976 she served as a history professor in the African-American faculty of George Washington University and became the first full-time black member. She also served as a primary consultant for the Schlesinger Library‚Äôs Black Women Oral History project during the course of her professional career. Aside from teaching history, Brown wrote and contributed to books on Washington DC such as Washington from Banneker to Douglas, 1791 ‚Äì 1870 and Washington in the New Era, 1870 ‚Äì 1970.  Early life and education  Letitia Woods Brown (n√©e Letitia Christine Woods) was born on October24, 1915, to Evadne Clark Adam Woods and Matthew Woods in Tuskegee, Alabama, U.S. One of three daughters, Letitia was the second child. The Woodses were a middle-class family; both parents worked as teachers at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), an industrial college established by Booker T. Washington. Matthew Woods was educated at the Tuskegee Institute. Letitia's mother Evadne Woods was one of twelve children born to Lewis Adams and Theodosia Evadne Clark. Her father Lewis Adams was a former slave who became a Tuskegee Normal School trustee and a commissioner in 1881. They all served as educators throughout the southern USA. Letitia Woods Brown attended Tuskegee Institute, as her father had. She graduated with a bachelor of science degree in 1935, during the middle of the Great Depression. While she continued her education, she briefly served as a teacher in the Macon County, Alabama segregated school system, where she taught 3rd and 4th grade in 1935 and 1936. She once stated, \\"The rural black school in the segregated post-depression era was deprived by any standard. There were never enough books and the teacher had to provide her own chalk, paper, pencils...\\". She subsequently obtained a Master of Arts degree in history from Ohio State University in 1937. It was a time when women of African American ancestry were unlikely to continue higher education and pursue degrees. After graduating from Ohio State, Brown and a group of Ohio State University students traveled to Haiti to pursue academic knowledge about Caribbean history and literature. She later wrote, \\"That trip was my first sally forth to see the world\\".  Career  On her return from Haiti, Brown moved to Alabama in 1937 and worked at the Tuskegee Institute as a history teacher until 1940. In 1940, she joined LeMoyne-Owen College as a history teacher after a move from Alabama to Memphis, Tennessee. She continued teaching at LeMoyne-Owen College until 1945. Brown faced the same problem as most black educators during that era, in that they were offered appointments to teaching positions in higher education only in historically African American universities and colleges. She returned briefly in 1945 to Ohio State University to take additional classes in Eastern history and geography. To seek a PhD degree in history, Brown moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts to attend Harvard University where she met Theodore Edward Brown. The couple married in 1947 and moved to her husband's hometown, Harlem. They moved again to Mount Vernon, New York where she worked at the local health and welfare council. Brown's efforts in the election campaign to elect an African-American proved successful and Harold Wood was elected to the Westchester County Board of Supervisors. She wrote, \\"At one point the plan we projected for electing a black to the County Board of Supervisors sounded so convincing we decided we really ought to try it... Harold Wood won the election to become the first back to serve on the Westchester County Board of Supervisors\\". The family again relocated in 1956 to Washington, DC. There she served at the Bureau of Technical Assistance as an economist. While living in Washington, her interest in the African American history of the District of Columbia grew. In later years, the topic became a major part of Brown's lectures and research. During her course for a doctorate at Harvard, Brown taught at the university, first as a teacher of social science and later of history, from 1961 to 1970. She was later appointed an associate professor. In addition to teaching and researching for her doctorate dissertation, Brown and her husband trained the earliest group of volunteers for the Peace Corps in preparation for a 1961 deployment in Ghana. At the age of 51, in 1966 Brown completed her PhD history course 18 years after she started, to become one of the first African American woman to obtain a PhD from Harvard University in history. In 1968 Brown served as a Fulbright lecturer at Australian National University and Monash University in Australia. Brown travelled to every part of southern Asia and southern Europe including Singapore, Jaipur, Istanbul, France and Italy before returning to America. On her return to the U.S. in 1971 she became a professor at George Washington University in the American Studies Department. Brown was the only black faculty member to serve full-time. She remained a member of George Washington University until her death in 1976. In 1972, Brown travelled again, this time to African cities which include Gao, Cairo, Segou, Marrakesh, Timbuktu, Fez, Ibandan, Benin, Axum, Kumasi and Luxor. Brown joined the American Historical Association committee on her return and served there until 1973. Her efforts helped to establish the Columbia Historical Society of Washington DC in 1973. Mastering the use of oral history, she also served in the Schlesinger Library‚Äôs Black Women Oral History project at Radcliffe College as a primary consultant.  Books  Apart from serving as a teacher and researcher, Brown wrote and contributed to several books on Washington, DC during her last years. Some of her books are: *Washington from Banneker to Douglass, 1791 ‚Äì 1870 (1971) co-authored by Elsie M. Lewis. *Washington in the New Era, 1870 ‚Äì 1970 (1972) co-authored by Richard Wade. *Free Negroes in the District of Columbia, 1790‚Äì1846 *Residence Patterns of Negroes in the District of Columbia, 1800‚Äì1860 *Free Negroes in the Original District of Columbia  Personal life  Brown married Theodore Edward Brown in 1947 and settled briefly in his hometown, Harlem. She met him while she was pursuing her doctorate in history from Harvard University. Theodore Brown was a doctoral student in Harvard University in the field of economics. He later became an economist. They had two children: Lucy Evadne Brown was born in 1948 and Theodore Edward Brown Jr. followed in 1951.  Death  After a career of more than four decades, Brown died at home aged 60 on August 3, 1976 in Washington, DC after battling cancer. Professor of philosophy at George Washington University, Roderick S. French said at the memorial service held at National Cathedral's Bethlehem Chapel on August 7, 1976 that:  Recognition  Following her death in 1976, the Association of Black Women Historical Society under Nell Irvin Painter's presidency established an award in her name, the Letitia Woods Brown Memorial Book Award in 1983 to honor scholars whose publications in the field of African-American Women's history are the best examples. An annual lecture in history at The Historical Society of Washington, DC was named \\"The Letitia Woods Brown Lecture\\". The Letitia Woods Brown Fellowship was also established by George Washington University in the field of African American history and culture. In November 2013, George Washington University organized the Letitia Woods Brown Memorial Lecture to celebrate the memory of Brown in the Jack Morton Auditorium. The ceremony was free and open to the public. Among others, Steven Knapp, current president of George Washington University was present at the lecture. During the lecture Knapp described Brown as \\"the first full-time African American professor at George Washington, a scholar of the history of the District of Columbia and a tireless advocate for the preservation of the city's heritage\\".

It was remade in Hindi on Star Plus as Silsila Pyaar Ka.  Significance  Generally storylines of Indian television serials deal with the socio-economic conditions of the country - violence towards women and other social evils. But Tumi Asbe Bole is absolutely a different serial, something out of the Sasu- Bahu (mother-daughter-in-law) melodrama.  Plot  With its name from the famous song Tumi Asbe Bole by Nachiketa Chakraborty, Tumi Asbe Bole is a poignant story of a young widow marrying her college senior for the sake of her little daughter.The show also speaks about the basic values of life - love, sacrifice and adjustment. The soap is about Nandini and Rahul - two young fellows living in Kolkata. Rahul who is unmarried, is a very honest and humble man, though coming from a rich family, he is totally different from the others of his family. He loves his step-mother Rupanjana Debroy, who had once, for her lust of riches, blackmailed Rahul's father into marrying her. On the other hand, Nandini is married and has a child, Jhumjhumi . She is a doting mother and a very responsible woman. Rahul is deeply in love with Nandini. They were in college together. Rahul had confessed his love to Nandini back then. But Nandini who had always admired Rahul as a senior had never expected a proposal from him. She turned down his love and moved on with her life. Being a conservative girl she chose to marry the man her family suited for her. In the meantime eight years have passed. Rahul has become a businessman and is successful in his professional life . Nandini, on the other hand, has given birth to Jhumjhumi. In the meantime, Rahul's sister, Riya falls in love with Nandini's brother Abhinandan. When Rahul and his family approach Abhinandan's family for alliance, he meets Nandini again. This unlocks a treasure trove of memories for both as they have not remained in touch over the years. Both feel a little embarrassed by the encounter. But as fate would have it, Nandini's husband dies in a car accident and Rahul becomes a part of Nandini's and her daughter's life. Though reluctant at first, Nandini marries Rahul for her daughter. But eventually she falls in love with Rahul too and discovers the secret of the Debroy family - how terrible Rupanjana can be and how she has come to be the head of the Debroy family, pretending to be a good mother. Nandini discovers the true character of Rupanjana - a lady, who would not hesitate to remove even her own children from her life, in order to achieve her dreams. Nandini realises that Rupanjana is actually using Rahul for her own sake and so she vows to save Rahul and Jhumjhumi from Rupanjana. Treading the footsteps of ‚ÄòChalo Paltai‚Äô (Let's change, which is the motto of Star Jalsha), ‚ÄòTumi Asbe Bole‚Äô manifests an evolved human relationship crossing all realms of selfless love. In today's world when everything is measured in terms of profit and loss, including love, Rahul's love for Nandini has never demanded anything in return. Even in a marriage, usually women are most accepting of the different aspects of their husband's life including step children. Men however are not that accepting towards their wives. But Rahul has wholeheartedly accepted Nandini and her child Jhumjhumi and he promised Jhumjhumi to be a loving father when she asked him - ami tomake baba bolt pari?(Can I call you my Dad?). Not only that, he has gone one step farther in making Jhumjhumi his most important priority. Even his relationship with Nandini follows from his relationship with Jhumjhumi. Rahul redefines the connotation of love, whose journey of being a husband starts with being a great dad first. The show ended with Rahul and Nandini reuniting with each other.

It was designed by Nellie McCredie and built in 1928. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 March 2000.  History  Uanda, a low-set timber cottage built in 1928, is situated on two blocks originally part of Suburban Allotment No. 21 granted to Michael O'Neill in 1855. The Allotment slopes down from Newmarket Road to Enoggera Creek. The land subsequently passed through the hands of several owners until the boom in residential development in the area during the 1920s and 1930s following the extension of the electric tramline to Windsor in 1914 and the Grange in 1928. The area became known as the Langley Bank Estate and the portion of the Estate between Vardon and Granville Streets was re-subdivided and additional streets added, including Clifton Street, before being offered for sale again as the \\"model Darrima Estate\\" in 1928. In April 1928, re- subdivisions 47 and 48 were purchased by Richard Jack, a young wool classer of Brisbane. By this time about 20 homes had been built in Clifton Street. The Brisbane City Council Building Application Register for 26 April 1928 records Jack's application for construction of the house at a cost of ¬£799. The entry records that the architect was N. McCredie and the builder HW Dillecate of Milton. The house was constructed promptly and Richard Jack and his family were living in the house by October 1928. The house is named on the 1934 detail plan for the Brisbane City Council Water Supply and Sewerage Department as Uanda. The name is thought to have an association with a property near Hughenden which had some special attachment for the Jacks. The Jacks remained in the house until 1960 when the property was sold. It was sold again in 1966 when it was converted to a duplex. The property has since changed hands several times. When constructed the house was rectangular in plan with a central projecting open front porch containing the entry steps and door to the south. The porch was flanked by bay windows and the house contained an entry hall, two bedrooms, kitchen, dining nook, living room, bathroom, sleepout verandah to the south east and laundry under. The kitchen had built-in cupboards; the bathroom had a laundry chute connecting to a cupboard in the laundry beneath the house; the lounge opened onto the entry hall through 4 large glass paneled doors; the lounge and main bedroom were wallpapered; other walls throughout the house were lined with vertical tongue and groove boards; and the living room had a plate rail. The house was originally painted cream with dark green to the bay windows. Uanda is currently the only identified work of architect and potter Nellie McCredie. The career of Nellie McCredie is typical of the careers of women who entered the architectural profession prior to World War Two. These early women architects were rarely able to sustain their careers and as a result, examples of their work are extremely rare. Only three Brisbane buildings, including Uanda, have been identified. The other two were designed by Elina Mottram who practiced in Brisbane from 1924 to 1926. Nellie McCredie was a member of a leading architectural family with associations with Queensland as well as New South Wales. She was the niece of well-known Sydney architects Arthur Latimer and George McCredie who from 1889 to 1893 opened a Brisbane office, as McCredie Brothers and Chambers. Nellie McCredie's cousin, Leith C. McCredie, was also an architect and worked in the 1920s in the Sydney firm of Robertson and Marks. Nellie McCredie graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture from the University of Sydney in 1923, one of Australia's earliest architectural graduates. After graduating, she worked briefly for Dorman, Long and Company, contractors for the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Later she worked with several unidentified architects in Cairns for about 10 months, then came south to Brisbane where she was employed from November 1925 to early 1929 as a Draftswoman in the Workers' Dwellings Branch of the State Advances Corporation. It has not been possible to identify any of the work produced by the Workers' Dwellings Branch as work by McCredie as government drawings of the period were rarely signed by their designers. It was during this time that she designed Uanda as a private commission. Nellie McCredie was concerned with improving the quality of life of the average Australian. In her Bachelor of Architecture thesis she advocates simple, chaste buildings in \\"appropriate\\" settings generously planted with trees, illustrating her ideas with \\"a pretty suburban cottage\\" not unlike Uanda in its symmetry, central entrance porch and simple hipped roof. In her preference for simple, classic buildings McCredie reflects the ideals of her university teachers, including Professor Leslie Wilkinson. Like many of her women contemporaries, her practice of architecture was not to be sustained. Having studied pottery in Brisbane under the master craftsman, LJ Harvey, McCredie returned to Sydney in 1932 where she became a professional potter, setting up a commercial pottery at Epping in partnership with her younger brother Robert Reginald (Bob) McCredie. She exhibited actively with the New South Wales Society of Arts and Crafts into the 1950s and in 1951 won the Society's Elizabeth Soderberg Memorial Award for pottery. Pottery by the McCredies is well regarded for its simplicity and craftsmanship. It is represented in five public collections in Australia: National Gallery of Australia, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Powerhouse Museum (Sydney), Art Gallery of South Australia and Shepparton Art Gallery. At some point the verandah was enclosed and in 1966, the house was converted into a duplex. When the house was sold in 1998, the owner intended to demolish it (there being no heritage listing at that time) to construct two residences for their family. However, when the Brisbane City Council Heritage Unit initiated research on the house, they discovered it was the work of one of Brisbane's few female architects in the period between the First World War and the Second World War and proposed that the property be heritage-listed, resulting in a court case to determine if the property could be demolished. The relatively short architectural career of Nellie McCredie was put forward as an argument that she was neither a serious nor significant architect and therefore the property's association with her was not grounds for a heritage listing. The resultant court case acknowledged that the property had been bought in good faith with the intention of demolition based on professional advice that there was no barrier to doing so, but ultimately decided that the property should be heritage-listed for its association with Nellie McCredie and not demolished.  Description  Street view, 2015 Constructed in 1928 across two blocks of land, Uanda is a low-set, hip-roofed, single-storey timber cottage set in a leafy street among timber houses of the same era. Rectangular in plan with a central projecting front porch flanked by bay windows, the house is clad with weatherboards and has a simple valance of timber palings to the lower level. The bay windows have bell-curved, shingle- clad skirts and multi-paned sash windows below flat projecting roofs and are supported on exposed timbers with a bird-mouth detail to the ends. The roof is tiled and has short projecting eaves with v-j boarded soffit. The house is elevated on concrete stumps, approximately one metre above the ground at the front and higher at the back as the ground slopes away. The porch is now enclosed with weatherboards, glass louvres and casement windows and contains two entrance doors, each with a concrete stair with steel balustrade. Internally, there is evidence of the original pair of timber framed doors in the southern wall. On the exterior, there is evidence of twin corner verandah posts with decorative cappings. The porch is generously proportioned and has had an internal dividing wall recently removed. The floors are covered with linoleum and the ceiling is timber v-j boarding. The original planning of the house is clearly discernible; public rooms with decorative details are located towards the front of the house and service rooms are at the back, although there are now two kitchens and two bathrooms dating from when the house was converted to a duplex. The principal rooms at the front of the house are lined in a compressed timber-fibre sheet material (known commercially as \\"beaver board\\") with decorative joinery, in particular, ornate cornices and architraves and a plate rail in the former living room, now divided into two smaller rooms. The ceilings have a grid-like pattern of timber strips and floors are timber boarding. Several of the interior doors are timber with four horizontal panels and some original hardware and there is also a multi-paned, timber and glass door between the front bedroom and hall. The original kitchen is located in the north-west corner of the house, is lined vertical timber v-j boarding and contains some of the original joinery, including a set of tall cupboards. There is a set of three casement windows over the sink and a small timber sash window next to the back door. A toilet is located on the landing outside the backdoor of the kitchen next to a set of timber steps. The second kitchen is located in the north-east corner in the former sleep-out. This room has a door and stairs to the back garden. On the exterior of this room there are several timber decorative details including timber capitals and panels of early, painted timber slatted blinds. The two bathrooms are located between the kitchens. Both have terrazzo floors, baths and small cabinets. The top of the laundry chute remains in one of the bathrooms, however, the chute itself and cupboard in the laundry on the ground floor have been removed. Two laundry hoists are located on a concrete slab in the back garden. A timber framed and fibro garage is located on the western side of the site.  Heritage listing  Uanda was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 March 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Uanda, a low set, single storey timber house built in 1928, is historically important for its association with the entry of women into the professions in Queensland, particularly into the architectural profession. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. As one of a small number of surviving intact examples of the work of pioneer women architects in Queensland and the only remaining architectural work of Nellie McCredie, Uanda demonstrates rare aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Uanda has aesthetic significance derived from its careful, symmetrical composition, interior detailing and its contribution to the streetscape - in form and massing sympathetic to its neighbours and contributing a modest presence to a leafy suburban street. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Uanda has a strong and special association with the work of Nellie McCredie, an important pioneer woman architect, potter and member of a leading architectural family with associations with Brisbane.

The remaining structures have been designated as a scheduled monument. The factory making bottle glass and some window glass opened in 1788 and closed in 1873. Little remains of the site, however it was excavated and preserved under sand before a Tesco supermarket and car park was built on it after 2000. History Oil on canvas of The Old Glass Works, Nailsea in about 1810 The glassworks was established by John Robert Lucas, in 1788 because of the plentiful supply of coal for the furnaces, from Elms colliery and other local mines of the Nailsea Basin and outlier of the Bristol Coalfield. The choice of site may also have been influenced by plans for the Grand Western Canal which was planned to include a branch to Nailsea. Lucas had previously had interests in a brewery and glassworks in Bristol and another at Stanton Wick. The company initially traded as \\"Nailsea Crown Glass and Glass Bottle Manufacturers\\". Lucas originally built two \\"cones\\": one for window glass and the other to make bottle glass. Some of the raw materials were sourced locally, including local sand (although this was later shipped in from further away) and lime from Walton in Gordano and Wraxall. Saltcake came from Netham Chemical Works in Bristol while kelp and other seaweeds were brought from Ireland and Wales. These were used in general manufacture and in some experimental work on the production of cylinder glass. John Hartley of Hartley Wood and Co moved to Nailsea in 1812 and began working with Robert Lucas Chance who was the eldest son of William Chance, one of the partners. In the 1820s a new cone was built which survived until 1905, and in the 1840s the\\"Lily cone\\" was added for the production of sheet glass. By 1835 the works became the fourth-largest of its kind in the United Kingdom, mostly producing low-grade bottle glass by Glassblowing. The products were sent all over the UK and some exported to the West Indies and the United States. Lucas's initial partners were William Coathupe and Henry Pater, although this company was dissolved in 1844 becoming Coathupe and Co. but then declined. In 1855 over 100 men and boys were employed. They were affected by a strike in the neighbouring collieries which stopped production. In 1870 it was brought by Chance Brothers but problems with coal supply lead to the final closure. In 1871 the works employed 319 people. The works closed down in 1873, but \\"Nailsea\\" glass, an example of the \\"latticino\\" decorative style, (mostly made by glass workers at the end of their shift in Nailsea and at other glass works) is still sought after by collectors around the world. Site today The mosaic commemorating the Glassworks, on the wall of the Tesco supermarket which now sits on the site. Part of the site of the glass works has been covered by a Tesco supermarket car park, leaving it relatively accessible for future archaeological digs. Archeological exploration was undertaken before the construction of the supermarket. Other parts of the site have been cleared and are being filled with a sand like substance to ensure that the remains of the old glass works are preserved. One surviving building, which housed French kilns and gas-fired furnaces, has been converted into a garage premises. The landscaped green space now sits on the site of the glassworks. The site was designated as a scheduled monument in 2004. Further preservation work was funded by Nailsea Town Council included planting and landscaping, following the removal of contaminated soil. A green space was eventually built on the site and opened on 30 April 2015 by local business owner John Brown.

The contest is held by the Environmental Partnership Association (EPA), an organization supported by the European Land Owners Association and the European Commission.  History  The European Tree of the Year competition has been running since 2011 and selects a tree from participating countries (now 15 in number) by public vote. It was inspired by an earlier Czech national tree contest. Most countries hold a national poll to select their entrant for each year. Nominations are made in the year preceding the award. Voting for the European tree of the year commences on 1 February each year and lasts until the end of the month. A live, online display of the votes cast for each tree is displayed until the last week in February when final voting figures are kept secret. The winner is announced at an awards ceremony in late March held in the EU Parliament, Brussels. Since 2015, there has been a promotional tree tour visiting many candidate trees during the voting month of February. Media PR events, and community, child led, art contests take place for each tree, with the winning art works being displayed at the awards ceremony. In more recent years, a #TreesInNeed blog has been promoted by the contest organisers to highlight the plight of numerous trees across Europe under threat of destruction. The UK's most successful tree in the contest is the Brimmon Oak, finishing 2nd in 2017.

Possessing a genius level intellect, he has a deeper understanding of the Quantum Field than anyone else and the understanding of many other highly advanced forms of science that he's managed to turn to practical application. He is also responsible for creating the X-Ionizer technology capable of cutting Captain Atom's skin and the skin of most invulnerable metahumans.First Appears in Captain Atom vol. 3 #1, 1983 Fictional character biography Doctor Megala was part of Project Atom, a secret government funded group that used new experimental machines to harness powerful energies, which is led by General Wade Eiling. Megala was employed by the United States Air Force as part on an expedition seeking to take samples from an alien known as the Silver Shield. In the process of getting a sample with a X-Ionizer knife that Megala created himself, one of his colleagues was killed by the Silver Shield. Megala was behind him so he did not get much damage although the radiation gave Megala a permanent disease, and his health continued to deteriorate throughout his life. He eventually lost any sight in his right eye and could no longer walk. Megala raised Robert Long, the bereaved son of his late colleague following the events of the Silver Shield, who would eventually become his bodyguard/servant and go by Babylon as an alias. He used his samples to work on a super-soldier program, along with General Wade Eiling. Their project led to the creation of Captain Atom and Major Force. He helped to create an elaborate cover story for Atom. When Captain Atom resurfaced from the Quantum Field, Megala was in a customized wheelchair that he created. He no longer could use his arms and need robotic arms attached to the wheelchair. Despite his condition, he helped Captain Atom learn about the Quantum Field as well as about his powers. The disease would bad enough that he asked Captain Atom for help (Captain Atom #39). He attempted to use Captain Atom's atomic energy to stop the disease which worked successfully but at a price: Megala became blind. Fearing that Eiling would eventually turn on him, Megala set up a contingency plan which would make public all secrets of the project once his heart ceased functioning. His heart did stop when Megala was killed while fighting Ghost/Alec Rois. His plan proved to be a mere bluff but Captain Atom decided to become the actual whistleblower of the product and confessed the truth on national television. Despite Megala's fear of Eiling betraying him, Eiling had a great amount of respect of Megala as he was the first one to kneel down next to Megala when he died. New 52 In the New 52 continuity Doctor Megala would once again oversee the experiment which leads to the creation of Captain Atom, this time being a manned flight into another dimension. The New 52 version of Megala appears to suffer from ALS, a muscle deteriorating condition that leaves him unable to move, or even speak without some kind of aid, whereas in the previous continuity it was his encounter with the Silver Shield that caused a similar condition that eventually killed him. Megala is the chief scientist of the Continuum, a research facility where the government keeps Captain Atom, helping him understand his vast powers while researching him. Though Megala doesn't see eye to eye with everyone on the base or even amongst his closest colleagues, he believes in Captain Atom being the key to new scientific discoveries. After Captain Atom discovered his own potential to heal injuries, diseases and physical defects, he approaches Megala regarding his condition, but is brushed off as Megala feels he is just fine as long as he can think and that the human body and its needs would otherwise distract him from that. During the end of the series, Captain Atom, unknowingly starts to bring the wishes of people to life around them. Bringing the deceased mother of one of the scientists back to life. Megala however goes on an abstract journey with Atom to the edge of space, where the explosive wave of the Big Bang is still in progress, the experience changes Megala as it does many others at the Continuum. Megala is later revealed to have created special operatives to be used as espionage super spies. Because of the earlier journey he took with Captain Atom, who exiled himself afterwards, Megala in an misguided attempt set his sights on harnessing Firestorm's superhuman abilities in order to relive that dream. DataXen, one of his personal operatives, is sent to capture and contain Firestorm. He uses a mind transfer through technological methods which he has developed. The mind transfer gives Megala control of Firestorm while pushing Ronnie and Jason into a corner of their collective mind, Megala's being more powerful than theirs. The Megala controlled Firestorm eventually battles Captain Atom after the Captain becomes aware of Megala's actions due to his vastly enhanced senses. Eventually Ronnie and Jason are able to reassert control over the Firestorm Matrix as it grows unstable during the fight with Captain Atom, sending Megala back into his own body.

Noli Me tangere by Antonio Raggi The architecutal outline of the chapel was designed by the Italian artist Gianlorenzo Bernini. The sculpture, which shows Jesus responding to Mary Magdalene with the words 'Do not touch me' upon her recognition of him following the Resurrection, was also designed by Bernini and carried out by his pupil Antonio Raggi, probably from 1649 to 1652.Wittkower, p. 271-2  Preparatory Work  A wash drawing exists in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, that shows the overall design, although it appears that Raggi made some changes to the sculptural group.Wittkower, p. 271  Patronage  The chapel was commissioned by Sister Maria Eleonora Alaleona. it is suspected that it was commissioned as an act of penitence for the behaviour of an unnamed relative of hers in 1636 - a nun who had tried to smuggle a lover into her convent only for the lover to suffocate to death in the chest he was hiding in.Mormando, p.93 The donation made was 3,000 Roman scudi (around US$120,000 in contemporary costs.)Mormando, p.xvii. This calculation is based on Mormando's assertion that 25,000 scudi is equivalent to 1million US$ in today's money.

Education He studied architecture at the √âcole de Paris La Seine, Paris and engineering at the √âcole Polytechnique and the √âcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es (now ). Career In 1977, he became interested in the subject of urban planning, particularly of planned communities, which helped shape his views on centralisation, social mobility, population density and, later, energy management. In 1982, he was project manager for the Universal Exposition and in 1983 was put in charge of the management of large Parisian civil state-sponsored projects. In 1986, the directors of SNCF (French State Railways) hired him to form a new architectural division. With √âtienne Tricaud, he laid the theoretical groundwork for the creation of new, large stations in a contemporary style, which he saw from the points of view of both urban planning and architecture: opening up the city, intermodal transport, traffic management, accessibility and commercial development. In 1997, he won the competition for the new high speed train station in Seoul, Korea. He and Tricaud created the multidisciplinary AREP agency (, \\"Management, Research, Interchange\\") as a wholly owned subsidiary of SNCF. AREP has since been involved in the development of many stations and other urban developments both in France and elsewhere. Duthilleul was a consultant on the Grand Paris project, working with Jean Nouvel and Michel Cantal-Dupart. From 2010 to 2012 he presided over the planning committee for Plan Campus set up by the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research. In 2012, he created his own practice, Agence Duthilleul.

Life Wagner was born in what was then south central Germany in the city of Chemnitz (which in 1953 was officially renamed \\"Karl-Marx-Stadt\\"). His father worked as a Tinsmith/plumber and as a lighter of the city's street-lights. He attended junior school from 1911 till 1919 which was followed by three years at a training college. During the 1920s he started an apprenticeship as an electrician and took various skilled and semi-skilled factory jobs. There were also periods of unemployment. He first joined a trades union in 1923. In 1928 Kurt Wagner learned the trade of a cobble stone-setter with the Chemnitz Tram Company (Chemnitzer Stra√üenbahngesellschaft), and he then worked at this craft till 1933. In December 1932 he became a member of the Communist party. The next month, in January 1933, the NSDAP (Nazi Party) took power and lost little time in creating a one-party state out of what had previously been an increasingly fractious multi-party democracy in Germany. The Communist Wagner was dismissed from the Tram Company without any notice period in April 1934. By now the Communist Party had been banned in Germany, but Wagner nevertheless continued to work for it as a courier in north Chemnitz, later becoming a district party leader in Chemnitz. He was arrested on 28 March 1935. He was sent for trial at the recently created People's Court in Berlin in July 1935 and sentenced to ten years imprisonment for \\"high treason\\". He remained in the \\"Super jail\\" at Waldheim (a short distance to the north-west of Chemnitz) till 24 April 1945. Six of his nearly ten years of incarceration were spent in solitary confinement. When liberation arrived, it was the Americans who reached Saxony first, and it was the US commander Major Ebbers who mandated Kurt Wagner to set up a city police force in Chemnitz, where between 8 May and 15 July 1945 Wagner, as the local \\"Kriminaldirektor\\", was in charge of crime fighting. It had nevertheless already been agreed between the Americans and Soviets that Saxony would form part of the post-war Soviet occupation zone. The US Third Army accordingly withdrew, and on 2 July 1945 the Soviet army took over Leipzig, the state capital. The Soviet military commander, Nikolai Trufanov, now had Wagner installed as Leipzig police chief in succession to Heinrich Flei√üner whom the Soviets suspected of entertaining pro-American sympathies. Kurt Wagner accordingly served as Chief of Police in Leipzig for more than a year, between 16 July 1945 and 16 September 1946. On 30 July 1946 the German Interior Administration (DVdI / ') was created in the Soviet occupation zone with responsibilities that included the national coordination of the new police service. One thing on which the Americans and Soviets had agreed in 1945 was that there was no place for a German army in occupied Germany, but the police service now established in the Soviet zone of Germany was nevertheless in some respects a quasi-military force, and the entire area was by now being developed into East Germany, a state modeled along principals approved in Moscow, and administered separately from the occupation zones to the west, administered by the American, British and French forces. The President of the East German DVdI was the former Police Chief from Thuringia, a man called . There were three vice-presidents: Kurt Wagner was one of the three, and he was the man responsible for the police. In October 1949 he moved to the Party's Central Academy at Privolsk in the Soviet Union where he undertook twelve months of special training. Between 1950 and 1952 he was in charge of the police station at , and in July 1952 he was promoted, but still only to the rank of Chief Inspector. Although East Germany did not feel able to create an army till 1956, in October 1952 military service grades were introduced for the Police Service, and in October 1952 Kurt Wagner became a General Major in the Kasernierte Volkspolizei, a police division which would later come to be seen as a precursor to the National People's Army. In 1952 he became Deputy Chief of Staff in the Police Operational Division, shortly afterwards promoted to the Chief of Staff position. There followed another interlude in the Soviet Union where from 1955 till 1957 he attended the General Staff Academy in Moscow and ended up with a degree in Military Sciences. He was placed in charge of East Germany's Military District III, headquartered in Leipzig, in December 1957. At the end of 1959 Kurt Wagner was appointed Deputy Minister for Defence, and on 7 October 1961 he was promoted to the rank of General Lieutenant.Klaus Froh & R√ºdiger Wenzke, Milit√§rgeschichtlichen Forschungsamt (Hrsg.): Die Generale und Admirale der NVA: Ein biographisches Handbuch. 5., durchges. Auflage. Ch. Links Verlag, Berlin 2007, . On 1 March 1966 be was promoted to General Colonel. A year after that he retired. Kurt Wagner lived in Strausberg till his death in July 1989, a few months before the German Democratic Republic which he had served over more than four decades ceased to exist as a separate state.

It is a 4 km long narrow road (about 40 ft. wide) with around 700 shops, named after the tanneries of the British India period located at the end of the Road. Tannery Road was officially renamed as Dr B S Ambedkar Road many years back, but it still is referred to by its old name. Tannery Road touches Fraser Town, Richards Town, Giddappa Block, Periyar Nagar and Pillanna Garden. The Tannery Road area is highly populated with a high density. The suburb presents a picture which is a shocking contrast to the hi-tech image of Bangalore. As elections has not brought about any changes, the residents express disillusionment with politicians and politics. Pot-holes and broken pavements are a common feature of Tannery Road, in addition to heavy traffic, water problems, garbage, etc. There is scant respect for traffic rules, and vehicles of all types zoom past in all directions. Residents have to dodge puddles of dirty water and garbage, to move around. Tanneries The tanneries were established during the British Raj, with the tanneries being located on the outskirts of the Bangalore Civil & Military Station, such that they were located at a 'safe'distance from the posh areas of the Bangalore Cantonment. Most of the buildings are 100 years or older, with some still carrying the insignia of the British Crown - the Lion and the Unicorn. The hides to the tanneries were and is still supplied by the slaughter house located at the beginning of Tannery Road. Gradually around 200 tannery units which have come up around the original tanneries set up in British India. In times gone by, people from the Tannery Road area were not allowed into the cantonment, and residents of the cantonment avoided Tannery Road. Around 5000 Arunthathiyar, Tamil Dalit labourers were brought by the British from Madras Presidency districts of Vellore, Madurai and Tirunelveli. The Tanneries are owned by Muslims and the labour consists of Tamil Dalits, from the original migrants. The raw skin is initially cleaned using water, then rubbed with salt and folded into a square like a saree, and this preserves the skin for another 2 weeks. The hides are then transported to Vaniyambadi and Ambur, Tamil Nadu. In 2006, many of the tanneries and curing units were shut down, and now there are only about 15 left today. Most of the labourers have moved to other professions, and their children also getting good education. Tanners have also migrated in large numbers to Ambur and Vaniyambadi, as a result of the declining tannery industry in Bangalore. The government proposed the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, which would have stopped the slaughter of cow/oxen, and would have struck the death knell to the tanneries. The Bill was however withdrawn by the strong Congress Government. Slaughterhouse The slaughterhouse (called as Doddi by the locals in Tamil/Urdu) is located at the beginning of Tannery Road, at the intersection of Pottery Road. It was established during British India, and is one of the few slaughterhouses in India, when cows/ox are slaughtered. It has an installed capacity of slaughtering 50 big animals and 200 small animals. However at least 150 big and 500 small animals are slaughtered everyday. The wastage is illegally dumped into the storm water drain located next to the slaughter house, causing issues of pollution and bad stench in the neighbouring areas. The slaughterhouse has been subject to many litigations, and recently Justices Cyriac Joseph and Ashok B in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) ordered the slaughterhouse be moved to Iblur, city outskirts. In June 2009, the Karnataka Pollution Control Board refused to renew the licence of the slaughterhouse as the effluent treatment plant was not in operation. An investigation by Indian Institute of Journalism & New Media found children aged 11‚Äì15 years working at the slaughterhouse, with the butchers (mostly Muslim) saying that they were unable to afford providing education to their children, and hence had them helping out in the slaughterhouse. Residents of Tannery Road Most of the residents of Tannery Road are Tamil-speaking Hindus and Christians, and Urdu-speaking Muslims. There are also small number of Marwari traders running businesses on Tannery Road. Majority of residents are low-income group and labourers. Poor, under- privileged Muslims live in enclaves of Tannery Road, particularly around D J Halli. Tannery Road is covered with cut-outs, cardboard arches and wall murals of BR Ambedkar, Thiruvalluvar, Mother Teresa, Subhas Chandra Bose, Bhagat Singh, etc. Political activity is intense, which according to some residents has an detrimental effect on Tannery Road's woes. Other feel that lack of education results in the lack of effective implementation of the rule of law. Older residents moan that even though the area was only 7 km from Vidhana Soudha, it was hundreds of km away from effective governance. There is a statue of BR Ambedkar, on Tannery Road, which often serves as venue for political meetings and protests. An annual Ganesh idol immersion procession passes through Tannery Road during the festival of Vinayaka Chaturthi, with the procession stopping near the statue of BR Ambedkar to pay its respects. Crime Tannery Road is classified as a 'sensitive' area, due to several communal flare-ups, with Police deployed during festivals, political rallies, and even India - Pakistan cricket matches. Some of the notorious history sheeters of the area are Marimuthu and Elumalai. Marimuthu runs the hootch business, and is the only woman in Bangalore Police rowdy sheet. She went on to be elected as BBMP councillor on a JD(S) ticket in 2000 and 2005, but however lost the 2010 elections to V Palaniyammal sister of her rival and notorious rowdy Elumamalai (contesting on Congress ticket). The Muslim underworld also has a presence around the Tannery Road area. Availability of cheap spurious alcohol, (known as hooch) is a problem around the Tannery Road area, with many dwellers getting addicted. Notorious bootlegger (who later became a councillor of BBMP) and Ameer Jan were running the racket. Hootch is brewed from industrial alcohol, by separating Methyl Alcohol, and adding water - A dangerous process which can leave traces of poisonous Methyl Alcohol. The brew is slow poison, damaging kidney and intestines, leading to slow death. On 7 July 1981, about 300 people (Official figures 229) around the Tannery Road area died as a result of consuming this spurious alcohol. Most of the victims were poor Dalits. Police registered cases against 63 people, but none were convicted or punished. An enquiry commission revealed a connection between some politicians and the bootleggers. A paltry sum of INR 1000 per family was paid to the victims by the Gundu Rao government. Present state In 2009 the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has a project to widen Tannery Road, from the present 40 ft. to 80 ft.. However, there is stiff opposition by the traders of Tannery Road. According to Vijayraj, President of the Tannery Road Merchants‚Äô Association, most of the owners of the 700 shops are opposed to the project. Further, they wanted the upcoming Bangalore Metro project to go underground in the Tannery Road stretch. In December 2009, the BBMP demolished 690 properties on Tannery Road, in the face of stiff opposition of the traders, offering a TDR of INR 3000 per square feet. Tannery Road is one of the proposed stations on the Gottigere-Nagavara line of the Bangalore Metro Project, Phase 2. Further, according to Pradeep Singh Kharola, MD of BMRC, problems were expected in implementing the Bangalore Metro Phase 2 project in densely populated Tannery Road. The suburb residents face problems of drinking water, with people having to buy water from private suppliers, and problems with garbage collection and disposal. Recently Tannery Road, along with surrounding suburbs of KG Halli, DJ Halli, has emerged as centre for illegal recycling of hazardous e-waste. The David Rattray Memorial Trust runs the Hope Foundation School, and English Medium School for the impoverished children living in the slums around Tannery Road. The children of the tannery workers are also embracing English Medium School, with many studying in Universities and surrounding colleges.

It is an old royal palace, with many historical connections. The palace was used as residence by queens Velu Nachiyar (1780‚Äì90), Vellacci Nachiyar (1790‚Äì93) and Rani Kaathama Nachiar (1864‚Äì77). No remains of the original Sivaganga Palace exist, but a new palace, known as \\"Gowri Vilasam\\", was built by Padamathur Gowry Vallabha Thevar (1801-1829) in the year 19th century. A heritage site of Chettinad, it was the property of Rani Velu Nachiar. Early history The original palace, built in 1730, was the venue of secret negotiations between Veerapandiya Kattabomman and the Maruthu Pandiyar brothers to overthrow the British regime. It came under attack several times between 1762 and 1789. The only remnant of the original palace was in the form of a high wall which has since been destroyed. Gowri Vilasam A new structure was built in the early 19th century by Padamathur Gowry Vallabha Thevar (1801-1829) and named the Gowri Vilasam. After Thevar died, his brother, Oyya, occupied the palace with his sons. He took over the leadership of the kingdom on the ruse that the British would take over, as the king had died intestate. They created false documents by forging the signature of the late king to take over the kingdom and crowned themselves sitting on the black marble stone of the court of the palace. Architecture and fittings The now dilapidated Gowri Vilasam is built in the architectural style of the Tirumala Naikas, which has some features of the Rajaputana arts. There was a clock on the front gate of the facade on the southern side of this place, no longer in a working condition. Within the palace is the Temple of Sri Raja Rajeshwari, with the deity Raja Rajeswar of the Royal House of Sivaganga. The temple is functional and the renowned poet Papanasam Sivan is said to have composed many popular songs extolling the deity. The temple also has a statue of the king Kandumekki Woodaya Taver. Grounds The palace grounds contain the Durbar hall of the past kings, which honour notable poets. Within the palace grounds is a black marble square, with a carved marble seat which was used to rule a court of justice; it was used during the dynastic period for the crowning ceremony of new kings. Another important feature is the \\"teppakulam\\", a large masonry tank or reservoir which fronts the palace.

History The first section of the Merthyr, Tredegar and Abergavenny Railway from Abergavenny to was opened on 29 September 1862. The line was leased and operated by the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR;) which acquired the smaller railway company on 30 June 1866. The L&NWR; was itself amalgamated into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in the 1923 Grouping. Gelli Felen Halt was opened by the LMS on 6 September 1933. It was situated to the west of the twin-bore Gelli Felen Tunnel (Down ; Up ) from which the station was reached on a sharp left-hand curve where flangeless 0-8-4T locomotives had in the past derailed. At this point the line ran along the sheer rock face of the cutting side which was reinforced with engineering brick. Gelli Felen railway halt was in an isolated location on a 1 in 38 gradient on a sharp curve requiring check rails to prevent derailment. Short staggered platforms were provided with a barrack- like brick huts as passenger shelters. To the west of the station there had been a signal box, crossover and siding but these had gone by 1931; the signal box was opened on the Up side in 1898 and was known as Gellavalln. As a result of decline in the local industry and the costs of working the line between Abergavenny and Merthyr, passenger services ceased on 4 January 1958. The last public service over the Merthyr line was an SLS railtour on 5 January 1958 hauled by GWR 6959 No. 7912 Little Linford Hall and LNWR Coal Tank No. 58926. Official closure came on 6 January. Present The platform shelters have survived in an overgrown state and the trackbed through the station is part of National Cycle Route 46.

She was credited in the Hadow Reports with being one of the founders of the formal education of infant teachers in Britain. She was the first woman in England to be employed to train teachers. Life Mayo was born at 1 Hammet Street, Aldgate in London, on 18 June 1793. Her father was a lawyer, Charles Mayo and his wife, Elizabeth Knowlys. Charles Mayo who was Elizabeth's brother returned from Switzerland to work with her. Charles had lived with Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi from 1819 to 1822 at Yverdon and he was inspired by his ideas. The two siblings were credited in the Hadow Reports with founding the formal education of infant teachers in Britain.Hadow Report, EducationEngland, retrieved 1 January 2014. Mayo was the first woman in England to be employed to train teachers. Her books titled Lessons on Objects and On Shells, on object lessons, were revolutionary as they were the first to explain education to infant teachers. Mayo's book Lessons on Objects showed how young children could be introduced to new ideas by examining 100 objects like a wooden cube, a pin, a rubber or a piece of glass. The book supplied example dialogues between teacher and child and a list supplied for an object like a pin to get the children to recognize the parts and the qualities of this object.Lessons on Objects , Elizabeth Mayo, 1861, Roehampton University, download, retrieved 1 January 2014. By 1831 her book had such success that John Frost was creating a plagiarised, edited or improved version for the American market. Charles, Elizabeth, James Pierrepont Greaves, and John Stuckey Reynolds founded the Home and Colonial School Society in Gray‚Äôs Inn Road in 1836, which was an Anglican society dedicated to the ideas of Pestalozzi; and Elizabeth's publications introduced educational ideas that ignored the idea of rote-learning. The new organization included a model infant school where the ideas could be developed,Home and Colonial School Society, UCL, retrieved 1 January 2014. and Elizabeth took a supervisory role. More than her brother, Elizabeth argued that educational improvements must include a religious aspect. It was reported that by the end of the 1840s that nearly every vacancy was being filled by graduated from the Mayo institution.Janet Shepherd, ‚ÄòMayo, Elizabeth (1793‚Äì1865)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 1 Jan 2015 Known as the Home and Colunial Training College it was the only teaching establishment using Pestalozzi's object based teaching methods. Pestalozzi was using illustrations but the Mayo siblings insisted on the value of actual objects. This technique was thought to be particularly valuable with under- privileged students who could aspire to moving from just naming the parts of an object to writing an essay about its qualities. Legacy Highbury Fields School in London is credited with being a successor institution to the educational ideas introduced by Charles and Elizabeth Mayo. Mayo died in Malvern in 1865.
